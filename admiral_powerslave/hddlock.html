<br>
This is called an ATA-password. Also known as a HDD Password, HDP,
Security lock, HDD Security feature.&nbsp; It is a standard included in
the ATA Specification. (read the ata-spec). If a drive is locked it (to
be precise the controller on the harddrive pcb) will reject all
read/write operations and some other operations (NOT ALL!!!). Thus it
is impossible to use any software-tools only to read/wipe the password.<br>
<br>
Swapping the harddrive pcb with another identical one from a unlocked
drive will NOT clear or bypass the lock since the password(s) are
stored in the "system maintenance cylinder" (at cylinder address
16,384). On this cylinder, are other important data stored like:
track-layout information, calibration information, identification,
serial and so forth.<br>
<br>
The lock exists of 2 securitylevels: high and max. There are two
passwords possible: User and Master. If the securitylevel is set to MAX
only a userpassword can unlock the drive. If the securitylevel is set
to high a user AND a master password can unlock the drive. The password
can consist of 32 bits max by the way.<br>
<br>
A disk always has two passwords: A User password and a Master password.
Most disks support a Master Password Revision Code, which can tell you
if the Master password has been changed, or it it still the factory
default. The revision code is word 92 in the IDENTIFY response. A value
of 0xFFFE means the Master password is unchanged.<br>
<br>
A disk can be locked in two modes: High security mode or Maximum
security mode. Bit 8 in word 128 of the IDENTIFY response tell you
which mode your disk is in: 0 = High, 1 = Maximum.<br>
<br>
In High security mode, you can unlock the disk with either the user or
master password, using the "SECURITY UNLOCK DEVICE" ATA command. There
is an attempt limit, normally set to 5, after which you must power
cycle or hard-reset the disk before you can attempt again.<br>
<br>
In Maximum security mode, you cannot unlock the disk! The only way to
get the disk back to a usable state is to issue the SECURITY ERASE
PREPARE command, immediately followed by SECURITY ERASE UNIT. The
SECURITY ERASE UNIT command requires the Master password and will
completely erase all data on the disk. The operation is rather slow,
expect half an hour or more for big disks. (Word 89 in the IDENTIFY
response indicates how long the operation will take.)<br>
