<br>
<span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Each components on the xbox
motherboard has a unique identification number that looks similar to
R6D1 or C8F4. Each designation starts with a letter which let's you
know what type of part it is such as R for Resistor or C for capacitor.
To make component lookup easier, the boards have a grid system with
columns (1-8 along the bottom), and rows (A-G on top and M-V on
bottom).
First look at the digit after the first letter, this is the column,
the letter after that is the row. Finally there will be one last number
to specify which component it is (ie. if there are 3 resistors in the
same area this number specifies which one it is).<br>
<br>

<img alt="" src="graphics/lpc_pinheader.gif"
 style="width: 125px; height: 100px;" align="left"><br>
<br>
This pinheader is commonly used when installing a modchip. It is
soldered into the LPC port on the motherboard for the optimal modchip
connection.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="graphics/av_connector_sm.gif"
 style="width: 125px; height: 100px;" align="left"><br>
This is the video connector that is soldered on to the motherboard near
the video encoder chip (conexant, focus or xcalibur).<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="graphics/resistor_sm.gif"
 style="width: 125px; height: 100px;" align="left"><br>
<br>
Resistors are devices that impede the flow of energy.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="graphics/transistor_sm.gif"
 style="width: 125px; height: 100px;" align="left"><br>
<br>
Transistors are devices that amplify, oscillate and control the flow
of energy.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="graphics/diodes_sm.gif"
 style="width: 125px; height: 100px;" align="left"><br>
Diodes are devices which allow electricity to flow in one
direction, and does this by haveing one end highly resistive while the
other is low.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="graphics/capacitor_sm.gif"
 style="width: 125px; height: 100px;" align="left"><br>
<br>
Capacitors are devices that store electrical charges, and can be used
to maintain voltage levels in power.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="graphics/inductor_sm.gif"
 style="width: 125px; height: 100px;" align="left"><br>
Inductors are components that increase impedance as the frequency of
AC (Alternating Current) decreases. Typically these components are
found in power supplies, however, the xbox has a couple on its
motherboard.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="graphics/ics_sm.gif"
 style="width: 125px; height: 100px;" align="left"><br>
The ICS1893AF microchip allows the eithernet port to communicate with
the MCPX chip and provides the networking functions for the system.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="graphics/focus_sm.gif"
 style="width: 125px; height: 100px;" align="left"><br>
The Focus video encoder is one of three encoders used on the Xbox
motherboard. The Focus brand was introduced after the Conexant, and can
be found mostly in 1.4 motherboards.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="graphics/conexant_sm.gif"
 style="width: 125px; height: 100px;" align="left"><br>
The Conexant video encoder is one of the three encoders used on the
Xbox motherboard. The Conexant brand was used in the early motherboard
versions from 1.0-1.3, but, depending on which assembly factory you may
still find the Conexant chip on 1.4 models.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="graphics/xcalibur_sm.gif"
 style="width: 125px; height: 100px;" align="left"><br>
The Excalibur video encoder is one of the three encoders used on the
Xbox motherboard. The Excalibur brand is used in the 1.6 motherboard
version.<br>
<br>

 style="width: 125px; height: 100px;" align="left"><br>
V1.0 TSOP - This is for version 1.0 and early version 1.1
motherboards.&nbsp; It is a 1MB chip and is flashable. Four banks of
256k can be flashed and accessed.&nbsp; OE Bios is in all 4 banks from
factory.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="graphics/12_tsop_sm.gif"
 style="width: 125px; height: 100px;" align="left"><br>
V1.2 TSOP - This is for later version 1.1 and 1.2-1.4
motherboards.&nbsp; It is a 256K Chip and is flashable.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="graphics/xyclops_sm.gif"
 style="width: 125px; height: 100px;" align="left"><br>
For version 1.6+ boards, the TSOP was replaced with the Xyclops chip.
The
Xyclops stores the system bios, and it can't be flashed or altered.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="graphics/pic16lc63a.gif"
 style="width: 125px; height: 100px;" align="left"><br>
<br>
The PIC16LC63A microcontroller is responsible for handling the Xbox's
power such as powering the unit on, sending the eject signal to the DVD
drive, and powering down/resetting the unit.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="graphics/memory_sm.gif"

 style="width: 125px; height: 100px;" align="left"><br>
ATA100/133 Upgrade Cable.&nbsp; Can speed up load times of games and
levels from 31 seconds to 23 seconds. This cable basically reduces
errors on the IDE bus that cause resending of data (which in turn slows
data
Xfers due to retransmits), by each data line having a
seperate ground.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="graphics/cpu_heatsink_sm.gif"
 style="width: 125px; height: 100px;" align="left"><br>
<br>
The CPU Heatsink allows the xbox processor from overheating and burning
up. When used properly with the heatsink clip, and thermal grease, the
lifespan of your xbox will be extended.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="graphics/ver_1_gpu_sm.gif"
 style="width: 114px; height: 100px;" align="left"><br>
This is for the first version (1.0) motherboards that have a fan
mounted on top of the heatsink.&nbsp; The fan was removed from later
V1.1 and all other motherboard revisions.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="graphics/gpu_heatsink_sm.gif"
 style="width: 125px; height: 100px;" align="left"><br>
<br>
This is for the later version 1.1 and 1.2+ boards using the larger gpu
heatsink without the fan.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="graphics/daughtercard_sm.gif"
 style="width: 125px; height: 100px;" align="left"><br>
The USB daughterboards are used in the 1.0 version motherboards and
connect the controller ports to interface with the
mainboard.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reason the 1.0 version was the only
one to use this board was because of a problem within the MCPX in the
first version boards. Later with the release of the 1.1 board the
problem was fixed and allowed the controller ports to plug directly
into the motherboard.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="graphics/controllerport_sm.gif"
 style="width: 125px; height: 100px;" align="left"><br>
These are the USB controller ports.&nbsp; They plug into the
daugherboard on V1.0 Xbox, and in to the mainboard on V1.1+ versions.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="graphics/xbox_psu_sm.gif"

supply unit (PSU).&nbsp; There are three different PSUs.&nbsp; Version
1.0/1 PSU's have a single row of 12 pins to connect it to the
motherboard. Version&nbsp;1.2+ PSU's have an ATX style connector
which&nbsp;has two rows of ten connectors&nbsp;to connect it to the
motherboard. Version&nbsp;1.6 PSU's have an ATX style connector
which&nbsp;has two rows of ten connectors&nbsp;to connect it to the
motherboard.<span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">&nbsp; They are al
mainboard specific, and can't be interchanged.<br>
