afterI paid, till I threatened to turn him in to Ebay and Paypal, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">MY Message:</span>&nbsp; <small>I have
sent you THREE emails, where the hell is some information as to
what's going on?&nbsp; IF there is no response by Thursday, I am going
to
file a complaint with PayPal, this is rediculous!&nbsp; I know you have
a
lot of GOOD feedback, so why are you ignoring my
emails?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You
answered ONE before I took them, now that I bougt them I am
nobody?&nbsp;&nbsp;
You're going to put a 7-day waiting period on TRANSFERING funds, well
what waiting period to I have before you can even say thank you, and
ship them.&nbsp;&nbsp; I also have a list of those RARE cards you put
up, they
better be in there!<br>
      <br>
      <big style="font-weight: bold;">His Response:&nbsp;</big> I'm
having a seriously rough time right now. You think i'm selling
these out of boredom? Maybe you think i'm a little kid wanting a little
extra cash for video games or how about a blow pop&nbsp;or two from the
candy store? I work a hectic schedule with little time to go out and
get materials. Your case broke, I have to find time somewhere in my
work schedule during a fucking break to go out and get a new case so
your precious cards wouldn't get bent. I don't get a fucking day off
because money's a bit too tight to pass up an extra days worth of work
and I work too late to feel the need to get up early enough for much of
anything. Apparently, you're not happy with this service and i'm not
happy with your god damn attitude. Your money is being refunded. Now, I
don't want to hear what you have to say. All I want is the email
address you use for paypal, whether it's this one or not.+<br>

cost. Upon completion, the system will give you your total including

Well, one item was 29.95 to ship, the other was 16.50 and that =&nbsp;
46.54 right?&nbsp; Well, I went through the checkout and the shipping
was reduced to, yeah, 46.45! &nbsp; I even was going to order five Co2
tanks, and it still didn't give the shipping disccount.&nbsp; So, don't
believe what people say, they'll apparenty say anything to get you to
buy! &nbsp; </td>

The one about the Rims?&nbsp; Total jagoff about the whole
situation.&nbsp; Ebay made me remove the USER names, but I will keep
them on hand for anyone who ASKS.&nbsp; My guess us he cried and cried
about it to Ebay, sissy, and they didn't like it.&nbsp;&nbsp; They said
having the user names are not LEGAL, we'll see about that later, so I
just removed them, but the detail stands.&nbsp; If&nbsp; any of you
personally ASK for the user names, I will provide them for you.<br>
<br>
<big style="font-weight: bold;">FUCK YOU Ebay!&nbsp;</big>&nbsp; You
need to get more involved with the assholes you saw here!&nbsp;&nbsp;
Let some asshole cancel my bid because he didn't like the page?&nbsp;
People need to get some balls, or take the paperslips off their nads,
one or the other.<br>
