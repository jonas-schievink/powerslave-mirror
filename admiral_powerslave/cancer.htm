This, among other events of its nature what it what lead millions of American people to become the scum of their society; with Riots, and random killing sprees, for those who have felt their life was over anyway.</P>

<!--mstheme--></B></FONT><FONT FACE="Tahoma" COLOR="#008080"><STRONG>There is a vitamin found in all fruit seeds called vitamin B-17. Its components make it vital for survival without cancer. Vitamin B17, and information about it has been banned from most of the U.S. over 15 years ago, but now through the internet, no law yet can stop the information. 
<P>Vitamin B17 was the subject of great controversy 18 years ago when some of the world's top scientists claimed that when consumed, the components of the seed make it 100% impossible to develop cancer and can kill existing cancer tumors.&nbsp;&nbsp; <!--mstheme-->A verse from the Bible states that:<!--mstheme--> </P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New"><P>Genesis 1:29 God said, Behold I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.</P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><!--mstheme--></FONT><FONT FACE="Tahoma" COLOR="#008080">The pharmaceutical companies pounced on this claim immediately and demanded that FDA studies be conducted. Pharmaceutical companies conduct studies on patented chemicals <I><U>they</I></U> invented so that at the end of their study, if the drug gets approved, they have sole rights on its sale. (They made more than the mere 200 million that they invested) They never did studies on foods because they could not be patented and&nbsp;could be sold in any supermarket. <!--mstheme--></H3>
<!--mstheme--><!--mstheme-->The vitamin is found in most all fruit seeds, such as the apple, peach, cherry, orange, nectarine and apricot. It is also found in some beans and many grasses such as wheat grass. The hard wooden pit in the middle of the peach is not supposed to be thrown away. In fact, the wooden shell is a strong armor protecting one of the most important foods known to man, the seed. It was one of the main courses of food in cultures such as the Navajo Indians, the Hunzas the Abkasians, and many more. Did you know that within these tribes there has never been a reported case of cancer. (And there are doctors and scientists from the U.S. living within these tribes right now studying this phenomena) We don't need to make the seed a main course but we do need the equivalent of about seven apricots seeds per day to nearly guarantee a cancer free life. Other foods that contain vitamin B-17 are; bitter almonds, millet, wheat grass, lima beans and more. (The bitter almond tree has been banned from the U.S. years ago.) The seed contains the highest amounts of vitamin B17.<BR>
