firmware for the DVD-ROM found in the
original Xbox are now, or can now be hacked. The hack tricks the xbox
to read a burned
disc as being an original game. It seems however that you will still
have to sign the XBE's other wise the console will reject the disc.<br>
<br>
</font><span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">The drive modded was
the Hitachi 8050L. The good news is that the firmware in
this drive is very similar to the firmware in the Serial ATA Hitachi
GDR3120, used in the
XBOX 360.<br>
<br>
There are no details on where to get the Firmware.&nbsp; All there is,
is that it was done.&nbsp; There is no "proof" that it was done as of
4/18/06<br>
