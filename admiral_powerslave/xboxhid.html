CONSOLE HIDDEN FEATURES AND INFORMATION</big></big><br>
<br>
<big><big style="font-weight: bold;">Reset parental controls</big></big><br>
Go to "Settings" and highlight the "Parental Control" option. Then,
press X, Y, L, X at the passcode screen to reset the parental control
setting to the default value.<br>
<big style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
<big>In-game reset</big></big><br>
While playing the game, hold Start + Back for a few seconds.<br>
<br>
<big style="font-weight: bold;"><big>Progressive Scan Dashboard</big></big><br>
Note: This requires the Tsunami Xbox Live! update, a high definition
monitor, and the High Definition AV pack. Enable the 480p resolution
option in the Xbox's video settings. Then, press L + R + click Left
Analog-stick + click Right Analog-stick to switch to a progressive scan
display at the Dashboard.<br>
<br>
<big style="font-weight: bold;"><big>Reformat hard drive</big></big><br>
Note: Reformatting the hard drive will delete all of your saved games
and soundtracks. Go to "Settings", then "System Info". Then, press Y,
Left Analog-stick Up, Left Analog-stick Down, X, A.<br>
<br>
<big style="font-weight: bold;"><big>Hidden FMV sequence</big></big><br>
Insert an audio CD. Stop the CD when it begins playing at the CD player
screen. Press B, select "Copy", then press A. Use the "Select All"
option, then press A. Use the "Copy" option and create a new
soundtrack. Enter "&lt;&lt;Eggs&szlig;ox&gt;&gt;" as a name. Select

<big><big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Bonus video</span></big></big><br>
Place any Xbox game in a standard DVD player to view a short bonus
video.<br>
<br>
<big><big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Starfield display</span></big></big><br>
Note: This trick requires the DVD playback kit. When the music is
stopped or paused, a small starfield-style display will appear in the
jewel that plays with the music. To zoom in on this, press Info. Then,
press Stop or Pause. After the lights fade, the starfield will be in
full screen.<br>
<br>
<big><big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Xbox Live information and
settings</span></big></big><br>
Note: This only applies if you have Xbox Live. In the Xbox Dashboard,
go to "Settings", then to "Network", and choose "Connect" so that it
tests your connection. When it is finished, press Y to view the
information about your connection to the Xbox Live network. You can
also press Black to save your network settings so that you can bring
them with you on a memory unit.<br>
<br>
<big><big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Xbox Live upload performance</span></big></big><br>
Adjusting the MTU settings on your router may give you a better upload
rate. Go to your set up page and adjust the MTU setting to 1490. This
is found on the filter settings on most routers. Microsoft recommends a
setting of at least 1460. Raising it to 1490, then selecting apply and
making sure it is enabled should increase your upload speed. Turn off
your computer and power down the modem then the router, in that order.
Wait for 60 to 90 seconds then plug in the modem and wait until it goes
through the boot up process. Then, power up your router and turn on
your computer. You should only have to do this one time. Then, go to
the connect test on your Xbox and see if the upload has increased.<br>
<br>
<big><big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Playing burned music discs</span></big></big><br>
Burn music onto a CD-RW (not a CD-R) disc, and close the session when
you burn the CD. Place it in your Xbox and rip away. Note: This also
works with .MP3 files. The Xbox can store .MP3s and replay them later
and saves a lot of space when compared to the .WAV files that are
standard on audio discs.<br>
<br>
<big><big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Music control</span></big></big><br>
To replay the current track of a song, press White. To skip to the next
song, press Black.<br>
<br>
<big><big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Move screen</span></big></big><br>
At the start up screen, press Y + X and it will move around slightly
and again to reverse it.<br>
<br>
<big><big><span style="font-weight: bold;">View music animations</span></big></big><br>
Insert a music CD and play it on the music screen. When the music
plays, you can see an animation in the jewel (that plays with the
music). To make this full screen, press Y then press X. To return to
the track selection, press any other button. Note: You can make the
jewel full screen when using the DVD remote by pressing Info.<br>
<br>
<big><big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Hear voices</span></big></big><br>
When the dash is started, leave it alone for a short time. The screen
will eventually get dark, and you will begin to hear sounds. One of
these is an electronic voice.<br>
<br>
<big><big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Console name</span></big></big><br>
Each Xbox console has a "name" assigned to it at the time of
manufacture. To view the name of your system, play Halo and link it to
another Xbox and choose a linked play party. The Xboxs will have names
above their symbols in the pre-game stat screen. To change your name,
play challenge mode in Dead Or Alive 3. Successfully complete challenge
mode and you will be prompted to enter a record name. Enter the name
that you wish to change your pre-assigned Xbox name to. This will now
be the title your Xbox is referred to during linked play. Note: This
will only work one time, so be sure that you enter the name you wish to
permanently have for your console. To see your Xbox name easily, start
Halo, go into multi-player mode, choose "Split Screen", "Profile", and
"Location". After all that is done, there will be a screen that reads
"Waiting for more players". The picture of the Xbox is directly above
your profile name, and above your picture will be a word. That word
will be used as your name when XBox goes online. This works best when
there is only one controller plugged into the Xbox, so the multi-player
game will not start before you see your name. To change the name on
your Xbox you can also use Cel Damage. When you enter a valid cheat
code in the game, it will also change the name of your Xbox (for
example, "ENCHILADA!").<br>
<br>
<big><big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sub woofer warning</span></big></big><br>
If you use a surround sound system, do not place your Xbox next to your
sub woofer. It can erase the internal hard drive if there is no
magnetic shielding around the sub woofer, as there is no magnetic
shielding on the Xbox's hard drive.<br>
