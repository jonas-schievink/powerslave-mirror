360 PROBLEMS</big></big><br>
<br>
Well, what do you know, problems with the Xbod360 right out of the box
on release day, who would have figured!&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">One red light flashes on the Ring of
Light:</span>&nbsp; Hardware failure. Restart the console. Contact Xbox
Customer Service if the problem is not resolved. If the agent cannot
help you resolve this issue, you will have to return the console to
Microsoft for repair.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">One red light flashes on the Ring of
Light and you receive an error message:</span>&nbsp; Hardware failure.
Restart the console. Contact Xbox Customer Service if the problem is
not resolved. If the agent cannot help you resolve this issue, you will
have to return the console to Microsoft for repair.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Two red lights flash on the Ring of
Light:</span> This behavior occurs when the console is too hot.&nbsp;
Power down for a while.&nbsp; Check sufficient ventilation. Verify the
cooling fan is working.&nbsp; If the two lights continue to flash red
after you tried the solutions, contact Xbox Customer Service. If the
agent cannot help you resolve this issue, you will have to return the
console to Microsoft for repair.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Three red lights flash on the Ring of
Light:</span> Hardware failure. Restart the console. Contact Xbox
Customer Service if the problem is not resolved. If the agent cannot
help you resolve this issue, you will have to return the console to
Microsoft for repair. <br>

 style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Four lights flash red on the Ring of
Light:</span> The A/V cable is not correctly connected to the Xbox 360
console. The cable is not being detected by the console.&nbsp; Verify
proper installation of the A/V Cable.&nbsp; This error will not occur
if the cable is improperly plugged into a TV or VCR.&nbsp; Try another
cable.&nbsp; If the four red lights continue to flash after you follow
these troubleshooting steps, the Xbox 360 console may have to be
repaired. Contact Xbox Customer Service.<br>
<br style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
If your Xbox360 is crashing a lot, like once every 20 minutes, take the
power supply off the ground and suspended it in the air with something,
maybe with string?&nbsp; Keep the vents away from the floor, and never
set it on carpeting.<br>
<br>
System crashes at Microsoft Game Studio Screen - ?<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">If the console won't boot after
continued turning in and off:</span> Unplug it for about 5 minutes then
plug it back in and try again.</span><br

 style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Error numbers I have seen:&nbsp; </span><br>
57 - White Checkered Block patterns going horizontally across the
screen - Overheating<br>
64 -&nbsp; Comes up after the M$ Startup Screen - HDD Drive Issue?
Remove and reconnect HDD.<br>
65 -<br>
66 - Dvd firmware does not match what was originally in the console's
EEPROM.&nbsp; An attempt to curtail DVD firmware mods.&nbsp; Update the
hacked firmware to fix.<br>
71 - Dvd drive model number did not match what was originally in the
console.&nbsp; This was a side effect of E66's purpose.&nbsp; If
Microsoft did a warranty repair, and they substitiuted DVD drives, you
may get this Error.&nbsp; They had it fixed within 24 hours.<br>
73 -<br>
74 - Hard Drive Issue?&nbsp; Remove HDD, and boot.&nbsp; If ok, then
try with the HDD, if not, HDD is defective.<br>
79 - Blocked Lines going vertical down screen - Overheating<br>
<br>
In those HDD error cases, remove the HDD completely and boot without
the HDD and see if you get the error.<br>

 style="font-weight: bold;">Note [11/27/2005]:</span></big><br>
If you played any of the STORE DEMO machines, you notice most are
enclosed in plastic, and they seem to work ok, right?&nbsp; Well, those
consoles are not running at full capacity, meaning 3.2Ghz each
core.&nbsp; Those beta units, as some call them are only running at
2.3Ghz each core, or something to that effect.&nbsp; That significantly
cuts down on heat, and power consumption putting less stress on the
external power supply, and the unit itself.&nbsp; That is why none of
those store demo units are demonstrating any of these problems.&nbsp;
By all means, that unit being enclosed inside a "plastic bubble" should
overheat within 15 minutes!&nbsp; They do not!&nbsp; Why is that?&nbsp;
Well, you have a partial answer.&nbsp; That, or M$ made sure the demo
units were the cream of the crop, leaving the release day units the
sub-standard ones.<br>
<br>
It is all seming to boin down (up rather) to heat problems. If you know
someone whos Xbox360 is working, borrow their power supply and see how
yours works.&nbsp; Removing the HDD as a remedy means that less current
is being drawn from the power supply, which is why it now works, though
it could be a bad HDD, but that is slimmer than the power supply being
the culprit.&nbsp; There are two different power supplies, the plugs
are slightly different, and is different shade of grey.&nbsp; <br>
