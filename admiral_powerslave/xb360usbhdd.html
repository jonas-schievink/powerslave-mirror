USB HARD DRIVE</big></big><br>
<br>
<big style="font-weight: bold;">Plugs into the the REAR USB port.</big><br>
<br>
<big style="font-weight: bold;">All you need is the following:</big><br>
<br>
- A hard drive of your choice.&nbsp; The drive of choice is not
important as long as you can get a USB 2.0 adapter for that type of
drive.<br>
<br>
- A USB 2.0 adapter for the type of drive you will be using.<br>
<br>
OR<br>
<br>
- Purchase an External 2.0 USB Hard Disk from a retailer (Best Buy,
CompUSA, Ciccuit City).&nbsp; Average cost is 119.00 for a slim 60GB
drive to over 200.00<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; for 200+ Gb Drives.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
If your using a laptop 2.5" ATA drive that has a form factor height of
9.5mm or less then use an Ultra slim USB 2.0 case.&nbsp; It is perfect
and looks great sitting on top pf the original Xbox's HDD.&nbsp; Just
about any USB 2.0 adapter will work.&nbsp; AS stated above, these can
be purchased complete at a retailer.<br>
<br>
The Xbox 360 supports removable and portable devices via USB.&nbsp;
Most of these devices use the FAT32 file system which is capable of
volume sizes up to 2 TB.&nbsp; Windows 2000 and XP can read and write
to FAT32 volumes of large size but cannot natively create or format
them above 32 GB.&nbsp; In order to create a FAT32 partition and format
it above 32GB you will need a utility like Partition Magic or some
other drive/partition utility.&nbsp; Windows 98 does support the
creation and formatting of FAT32 partitions up to 127 GB in size.&nbsp;
If you have 98 installed or a 98 boot disk with FDISK.EXE and
FORMAT.COM you would have all you need for up to that 127GB mark
pending your drive is installed via the IDE interface or you have a USB
driver loaded. <br>
<br>
This is a really simple process.&nbsp; First assemble the drive with
the USB adapter.&nbsp; Next plug the unit into your PC.&nbsp; If your
running Windows XP most USB adapters will be automatically recognized
and installed.&nbsp; If you are running an older operating system you
may need to install a driver for the adapter.<br>
<br>
Next create a new FAT32 partition on the newly installed device.&nbsp;
Again if the drive is larger than 32GB you will need to use a utility
like Partition Magic to create the volume.&nbsp; If the drive is
smaller than 32GB you can accomplish this via the "Computer Management"
found in the Control Panel &gt; Administrative tools.&nbsp; Last you
need to format the volume.&nbsp; The same rule applies for formatting
as well; if it is larger than 32GB you will need some other utility
like partition magic to format.&nbsp; Windows XP and 2000 does not
natively support the creation and formatting of devices larger than
32GB.<br>
<br>
Once you've got it all done you should be able to load content to the
drive via windows.&nbsp; Plug it into your 360 and go to media and
select portable device and all your loaded media should be there.<br>
