<br>
If you have a V1.0/1.1 XBOX Console you need a 1 MB (1024 KB) BIOS.<br>
If you have a V1.2/1.3/1.4/1.5 XBOX Console you need a 256 KB BIOS.<br>
<br>
The X-Ecuter 2 4981 BIOS what you should use for the TSOP flash.&nbsp;
Use another at your own risk.<br>
<br>
There is no Flashable chip on the V1.6 Xbox and up!<br>
<br>
You DO NOT have the flasdh the TSOP unless you want to, with a
SOFTMOD.&nbsp; Some insallers are made just for flashing the TSOP,
sofrmods are not, they are optional.<br>

THE ONBOARD TSTOP METHOD</span><br>
<span style="color: rgb(255, 204, 153);">Used: 007AufEvoXInstaller</span><br>
<br>
I take no responsibility for any damage that may be done to your
xbox.&nbsp; I put this together to make it easier for me, and me only,
so if you use it then it is on your head.&nbsp;&nbsp; This quick how to
must have tsop points connected to flash. If you dont know what a tsop
point is stop now.&nbsp; Find out HOW to solder the Tsop Points, and
come back.&nbsp; The Tsop Points are to remove the WRITE PROTECT for
the Xbox onboard Eeprom.<br>
<br>
1. You need a memory save to xbox hdd how you do this is up to you
(Memory Card Works best). I use the Action Replay<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; system.&nbsp; Find the 007 Agent Under
Fire&nbsp; game save that has the SoftMod EvoX installer in it.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
2. Start 007 and load save from hdd. <br>
<br>
3. EvoX will come up.&nbsp; If you havent put a bios in the bios dir
already you can ftp one to the box now. <br>
<br>
4. You can now copy evox to hdd with the last option, and do this
first. (when you flash it resets. you can copy later but you will have
to reload 007) <br>
<br>
5. Now go to the system utils menu and run the flash utillity.&nbsp;
When it resets you have a modded xbox, evox is installed.&nbsp; What
you do then is up to you.&nbsp; The evox that loads from 007 is signed,
the installed evox is original, so it's not signed this means that even
if it is installed it will not run unless the box is flashed. <br>

<a name="whatIdid"></a>I have softmodded and flashed the TSOPed a V1.3
Xbox with TWO solder jumpers (as seen all over the net).&nbsp; You do
not need to solder any points on the UNDERSIDE of the
motherboard.&nbsp; I have done it, so that is proof.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">All you need is:</span><br>
Action Replay For PC<br>
Splinter Cell Game Disc (not platinum to be sure) <br>
Memory Unit 8MB:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Splinter Cell [LINUX] Profile (found on the net)
(can sometimes be found in the community saves on AR)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SID 4 INSTALLER (found on the net) </span><span
 style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">(can sometimes be found in the
community saves on AR)</span><br>
<span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">If Flashing TSOP that is a Winbond:</span><br>
Linux Flash BOOT Disc (Eurasia) - Winbond &amp; Somer other TSOPs EvoX
Can't Handle<br>
Bios Disc (DVD-R, or CD-RW With raincoat &amp; bios.bin) </span><span
 style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">- Winbond &amp; Somr other TSOPs
EvoX Can't Handle<br>
<br>
Turn Xbox on to Microsoft dash<br>
Remove or backup all other Splinter Cell saves.<br>
Copy contents of MEMORY CARD to XBox<br>
Boot Splinter Cell disc<br>
Choose LINUX profile.<br>
<br>
IT should load the SID 4 instaler, and all is self explanitory in the
menu!<br>
<br>
It took me all of 10 minutes to do this myself, it is NOT hard.<br>
<br>
If you want to FLASH the TSOP, you can run EvoX and flash it for rmost
TSOPs when write enabled.&nbsp;&nbsp; Put the bios file-via- FTP&nbsp;
in E:\BIOS as this is where EvoX is running from with SID
4.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can choose FLASH BIOS from EvoX.<br>
<br>
If you have an XBox with a WINBOND TSOP:<br>
Make your Flash and Bios Disc<br>
Be at the Evox Dash, and Launch the Linux Flash Disc (DVD-R)<br>
<br>
FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS!&nbsp; READ THE SCREEN!<br>
<br>
If successful, when Xbox reboots you're either going to get the BIOS's
logo, ot nothing of failed.<br>
<br>
Be sure yu have a valid BIOS!!!<br>
