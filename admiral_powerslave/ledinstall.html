<br>
You can add external lighting to the Xbox.&nbsp; The following
information is a generlization.&nbsp; You may have to do more research
for specific applciations.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><big>LED:</big>&nbsp;</span> LED's are
special diodes that emit light when connected in a circuit. They are
frequently used as "pilot" lights in electronic appliances to indicate
whether the circuit is closed or not. A a clear (or often colored)
epoxy case enclosed the heart of an LED, the semi-conductor chip.<br>
<br>
<big style="font-weight: bold;">POLARITY:</big> The two leads extending
below the LED epoxy enclosure, or the "bulb", indicate how the LED
should be connected into a circuit. The negative side of an LED lead is
indicated in two ways: 1) by the flat side of the bulb, and 2) by the
shorter of the two leads extending from the LED. The negative lead
should be connected to the negative terminal of a battery. LED's
operate at relative low voltages between about 1 and 4 volts, and draw
of current is between about 10 and 40 milliamperes (mA). Voltages and
currents substantially above these values can melt a LED chip. <br>
<br>
<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">CURRENT LIMIT RESISTOR:&nbsp;</span></big>
You need a resistor attached to the negative side of the LED so that it
will not pull more current than is required to light the LED.&nbsp;
LEDs have a negative temperature coefficient of resistance.&nbsp; This
means as the LED heats up, its resistance decreases, and it will pull
more current.&nbsp; Unless the flow of current is restricted in some
way (such as by a current limiting resistor) the LED may simply keep
drawing more and more current until it self-destructs.&nbsp; The
resistor helps in assuring the curent draw is not more than the LED can
handle.&nbsp; It also helps so assure the Xbox power supply is not
being taxed when using multiple LEDs in a curcuit.<br>
<br>
<big style="font-weight: bold;">CALCULATING THE RESISTOR:&nbsp;</big>
Calculating the proper resistance of a current limiting resistor is
actually quite easy.&nbsp; To calculate the resistance, you will need
to know three things.&nbsp; 1. Supply voltage (Vs),&nbsp; 2. Operating
voltage of the LED (Vf), and 3. Operating current of the LED
(If).&nbsp; Once these three variables are known, they can be plugged
into the following formula to find the proper resistance value:<br>
<br>
<big><big>R = Vs - Vf / If</big></big><br>
<br>
Example #1: Red LED (1.8 Vf and 0.020 If) operating from 5 VDC supply:
R = (5V &#8211; 1.8V)/0.020 A = 160 Ohms.<br>
<br>
Example #2: Blue LED (3.4 Vf and 0.020 If) operating from 12 VDC
supply:&nbsp; R = (12V &#8211; 3.4V)/0.020 A = 430 Ohms (470 Ohms could be
substituted)<br>
<br>
Ok, so now we know the resistance value of the current limiting
resistor but what about its power rating?&nbsp; Here is how to
determine the power rating.<br>
<br>
Example #3: Blue LED (3.4 Vf and 0.020 If) operating from 12 VDC
supply: Voltage drop across resistor = (12V &#8211; 3.4V) = 8.6V<br>
Power in watts = I x E = 0.020A x 8.6V = 0.172 watts<br>
<br>
BLUE and WHITE LEDs require more voltage than Red, Green, and Yellow
(Most white LEDs are actually blue LEDs that contain a phosphor coating
that absorbs blue light, and emits a broad-spectrum white light).<br>
<br>
So in this example, and just about any you are going to use for your
Xbox, a 1/4 watt resistor would do fine.&nbsp; (1/4 watt = 0.250 watt)<br>
<br style="color: rgb(255, 255, 102);">
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 255, 102);">Using more
than one LED in Parellel:&nbsp;</span> Each LED gets its own
resistor!&nbsp; One voltage supply to the positive sides of all the
LEDs, then each individual negative side with resistor, then to ground
(-).&nbsp; Remember, your Xbox power supply is rated at so many
watts!&nbsp; Total up the number of LEDs you want to use, say 10.&nbsp;
Each LED uses 20mA (If), that's going to be 200mA of current.&nbsp;
Doesn't seem like much, but the Xbox's power supply does have its
imits.&nbsp; I doubt you would be able to use enough LEDs to kill the
power supply, but it's the 5V you do not want to over-step its
output.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 255, 153);">Using more
than one LED in SERIES:</span><span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 153);">&nbsp;</span>
This is different then when in Parellel&nbsp; If you have Six red LEDs
wired in series and operating from 12 VDC supply:&nbsp; (1.8V + 1.8V +
1.8V + 1.8V + 1.8V + 1.8V) = 10.8V total.&nbsp; R = (12V &#8211;
10.8V)/0.020A = 60 Ohms.&nbsp; This resistor is placed on the last LED
in the chain, on its negative side, then the resistor to ground
(-).&nbsp; </span><span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">You
normally do not want to
wire in series, because if one LED blows they all go out!&nbsp; Then,
finding the bad LED will be next to impossible.</span><br>
<span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><br>
<big style="font-weight: bold;">INSTALLING THE RESISTOR:&nbsp;</big> Of
course, you are going to need to drill the hole(s) for the LED(s), and
make sure there is room behind it.&nbsp; You can bend the leads
down/up, or cut them as needed, just remember the polarity!&nbsp;
Assure fitment before soldering your wires on to the LED.&nbsp; The
current limiting resistor can go on anywhere in the circuit, as long as
it is on the NEGATIVE side of the LED.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<big style="font-weight: bold;">POWER SUPPLY FOR LED:&nbsp;</big> You
can use a "Y" adapter for the Hard Disk power cable.&nbsp; You would
cut the oher end off and use the power from the RED (5V) or YELLOW
(12V) wires.&nbsp; The blacks are ground.&nbsp; Make sure all exposed
wires are coverfed or capped so they do not short out anywhere inside
the Xbox case!&nbsp; It is a lot easier than you think, just make sure
you know what you are doing!&nbsp; <br>
<br>
So, have fun with your lighting.<br>
