Knowing there was already software available for Windows XP to play
HD-DVD&#8217;s, could simply plugging the Xbox 360's HD-DVD drive into a PC
work? Well, no Windows needs drivers.<br>
<br>
If Windows wants drivers, drivers it will get. After installing <a
 href="http://home.comcast.net/%7Exboxman/Xb360HDDVD4PC.rar">these
drivers</a> magic started to happen. The HD-DVD drive was now
recognized in Windows XP. Now we needed a piece of software to actually
play the HD-DVD. And after some hard work we managed to find a version
of WinDVD 8 that was able to play an HD-DVD movie even on my low end
hardware (Granted with some stuttering).<br>
<br>
The Eternal case is cracked open to find out the
manufacturer, and model of the HD-DVD drive Microsoft was using (It&#8217;s a
Toshiba HD-DVD OEM drive).<br>
<br>
Mac users may be delighted to know that Apple computers instantly
recognize the HD DVD drive when plugged in, but unfortunately no player
exists that can play HD DVD in MacOS exists yet; however, DVD works
fine and it's only a matter of time before someone writes the proper
software.&nbsp; <br>

MAC SEES IT:<br>

The unit is basically a 5.25" drive in a USB housing, and enterprising
hackers have discovered that you can hook it up to a PC and play HD
movies through that.<br>
<br>
The hack seems to be as simple as finding a generic HD-DVD drive
driver, then getting PowerDVD or WinDVD8 with the HD-DVD upgrade on,
then plugging in the drive over USB 2.0 connction.<br>
<br>
Seems like Microsoft has unwilling created a cheap HD-DVD drive, for
any Windows user.<br>
<br>
I have seen PICs of Batman Begins being played through WinDVD8, so it
does work!&nbsp; <br>
