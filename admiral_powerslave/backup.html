Place that disc into the XBOX DVD drive.<br>
EvoX Dash will indicate "GAME" if it worked.<br>
Launch it, and try it out.<br>
<br>
I may not have all the steps in 100%, but you should be able to figure

</big></big><big style="font-weight: bold;"><big>GENERAL BACKUP</big></big><br>
<big style="font-weight: bold;">Backing Up To DVD - FTP, Qwix, and NERO.</big><br>
You will need a DVD burner + Blank DVDs, a copy of Qwix ,and Nero (or
similar) for this tutorial.<br>
You should use DVD-R media, good ones, no cheap stuff.<br>
<br>
This Method is longer, as you are Xfering, then Building, then Burning,
where as Qwix can FTP and build the ISO at the same time.&nbsp; IT also
leads you to believe that greater that 4.7GB games will burn, not
true.&nbsp; See note at bottom.<br>
<br>
</span><span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">1. Load up your Modded
dashboard , or the X3 Bios if you have an Xecuter3 mod chip, that
supports FTP.</span><br>
<span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><br>
2. Put your Xbox game disc into the DVD drive on your Xbox, EvoX will
say "Game In."<br>
<br>
3. Connect to your Xbox via FTP and browse to the D drive.<br>
<br>
4. Make a new folder on your PC somewhere easily accessible. Ensure you
have 6-9GB of free space on your PC hard disk before continuing.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
5. Select all the files and folders listed on your Xbox D drive, and
transfer them all across to the new folder on your PC.<br>
<br>
6. Once the files have finished transfering to your PC, open up Qwix
and click on the "Create ISO" icon on the left.<br>
<br>
7. Select "Local Folder" and press the browse button. Choose the
location of the folder on your PC where you put all the game files.<br>
<br>
8. Click the "Create ISO" button and choose a location to save the ISO
image to.<br>
<br>
9. Open Nero and choose "Burn Image" from the File menu in v5, or the
Recorder menu if you are using v6. Click Burn.&nbsp; Burn at 4x or
lower.<br>
<br>
10. Once the DVD has finished burning, test it in your Xbox, and if all
has gone well you can delete the files from your PC.<br>
<br>
<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE:</span></big> Xbox does not
read DVD+DL Media, so any game that is over 4.7GB will not work.&nbsp;
Step 4 says to be sure you have the space, but if it uses more than
4.7, you will need to erase some files that are not needed before
burning it to a single layer DVD-R.&nbsp; It also does not indicate you
need a Dual Layer burner, and that it is supported.&nbsp; I have not
heard of any game on a DL+R disc working.<br>
</span>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span
 style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><br>
<big><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="reduce"></a>REDUCING
GAME DISC SIZE:</span></big><br>
1.&nbsp; Look for any demos that may have been included in the game and
delete them, usually this is easy to guess as you'll see the demo
section from the main screen of your Game and they are usually under a
folder called 'Demos' or at least named something that will give you a
hint that its the game demo area.&nbsp;&nbsp; Deleting these files will
not effect game play, and the menu option for the demos will still be
there, just don't choose them/it.<br>
<br>
2. Often a game will be a 'Multi' game meaning it supports NTSC and PAL
along with different languages.&nbsp; So, if you browse through the
main game folders you will often see the different files intended for
these other versions.&nbsp; You should be able to safely delete any of
those files without affecting the game.&nbsp; If you plan on NTSC only,
then delete all the PAL movies and related data, if you know what to
look for.<br>
<br>
3. You can reduce the size of the MOVIES (FMV Sequnces they can be
called), by downloading the BINK Codec package <a
 style="color: rgb(255, 255, 153);"
 href="http://www.radgametools.com/bnkdown.htm">HERE</a>, compress
them, and then build the ISO with the COMPRESSED files.&nbsp; They may
look a little worse, but the compression for .SMK and .BIK files can be
uo to 10 to 1.<br>
<br>
</span>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span
 style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><big style="font-weight: bold;"><a
 name="nerosteps"></a>Step 1 - Locate the Xbox Game ISO</big><br>
First you need to make sure you've got an Xboxgame backup ISO to burn.
The file extension should be .iso. The icon for the file may vary but
if you have winrar installed on your PC the Xbox ISO will probably have
the winrar icon.<br>
<br>
<big style="font-weight: bold;">Step 2 - Open Xbox ISO with Nero</big><br>
Ok now open Nero and go to file and then open, navigate the file
chooser to get to your Xbox ISO, select the ISO and click open.<br>
<br>
<big style="font-weight: bold;">Step 3 - Check DVD Burn Settings</big><br>
Once you've clicked open you should see the Burn Compilation window.
Click the Foreign Image tab and make sure all the items are subdued
(you can't change), and it should say:&nbsp; Data mode 1, then Block
Size 2048, Image Header and Image Trailer should be 0.&nbsp; If they
are not then the image is not correct.<br>
<br>
<big style="font-weight: bold;">Step 4 - Burn Xbox ISO to DVD</big><br>
If all the settings were correct then click on the burn tab and choose
the lowest burn speed (this increases the chances of the DVD working in
the Xbox). Ok Now click Burn!<br>
<br>
Once done, boot MOD ON and try the backup.<br>

<br>
<big><big style="font-weight: bold;">Is All of This Legal?</big></big><br>
<br>
The installation of Linux on Xbox is not supported by Microsoft. People
argue that installing Linux on your Xbox does not promote piracy, and
therefore the DMCA should not apply. Xbox-Linux.org states that it is
not illegal to install Linux on your Xbox. However, it does void your
warranty.<br>
<br>
Looking further into the legality and ethics, you are running unsigned
code on your Xbox by using exploits to install Linux. Is that enough to
warrant Microsoft suing you? People have endlessly argued over whether
this is legal/illegal or ethical/unethical in forums. The "Free-X"
group released its exploit amid threats from Microsoft to sue them, but
no known cases were filed. The exploit worked with older version of the
Xbox dashboard software, which has since been fixed by Microsoft in its
newer versions of the Dashboard software. With regard to Linux
installation on Xbox, it seemed like Microsoft's main concern was with
the installation promoting video game piracy. In addition, the methods
listed in this project do not allow the Xbox to play pirated games.<br>
<br>
Currently, it is known that Microsoft auto-installs fixes for the
exploit when users connect to Xbox Live! While Microsoft does not have
an official policy on the installation of Linux on the Xbox, they do
release auto-installing fixes for every new exploit. <br>
