</head>
<body>
<b><font size=+1>Autorun.inf Commands</font></b>
<br>This document is a reference for the commands that can be used in an
Autorun.inf file. The autorun.inf must be located
<br>on the root directory of the cdrom. As a note, you can also place an
autorun.inf on each hard disk to show a seperate icon for each drive.
<p><b>COMMANDS</b>
<br>icon / label / open / shellexecute / shell / shell\verb
<p><b>icon</b>
<br>The icon command specifies an icon which represents the AutoRun-enabled
drive in the Windows user interface.
<p>icon=iconfilename[,index]
<br>&nbsp;
<br><b>Parameters</b>
<br>iconfilename
<br>Name of an .ico, .bmp, .exe, or .dll file containing the icon information.
If a file contains more than one icon, you must also specify zero-based
index of the icon.
<br>Remarks
<br>The icon represents the AutoRun-enabled drive in the Microsoft&reg;
Windows&reg; user interface. For instance, in Windows Explorer, the drive
will have this icon instead of the standard drive icon. The icon's file
must be in the same directory as the file specified by the open command.
<p>The following example specifies the second icon in the MyProg.exe file.
<p>icon=MyProg.exe,1
<br>&nbsp;
<br><u>label</u>
<br>The label command specifies a text label to represent the AutoRun-enabled
drive in the Windows user interface.
<p>label=LabelText
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Parameters
<br>LabelText
<br>A text string containing the label. It may contain spaces.
<br>Remarks
<br>The label represents the AutoRun-enabled drive in the Microsoft&reg;
Windows&reg; user interface. If an icon is also specified, the label will
be displayed below it.
<p>The following example specifies "My Drive Label" as the drive's label.
<p>label=My Drive Label
<br>&nbsp;
<br><b>open</b>
<br>The open command specifies the path and file name of the application
that AutoRun launches when a user inserts a disc in the drive.
<p>open=[exepath\]exefile [param1 [param2] ...]
<p>Parameters
<br>exefile
<br>Fully qualified path of an executable file that will be run when the
compact disc is inserted. If only a file name is specified, it must be
in drive's root directory. To locate the file in a subdirectory, you must
specify a path. You can also include one or more command-line parameters
to be passed to the startup application.
<br>Remarks
<br>See Tips for Writing AutoRun Startup Applications for further discussion
of startup applications.
<p><b>shellexecute</b>
<br>Version 5.0. The shellexecute command specifies an application or data
file that AutoRun will use to call ShellExecuteEx.
<p>shellexecute=[filepath\]filename[param1, [param2]...]
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Parameters
<br>filepath
<br>A string containing the fully-qualified path of the directory that
contains the data or executable file. If no path is specified, the file
must be in the drive's root directory.
<br>filename
<br>A string containing the file's name. If it is an executable file, it
will be launched. If it is a data file, it must be a member of a file class.
ShellExecuteEx will launch the default command associated with the file
class.
<br>paramx
<br>Any additional parameters that should be passed to ShellExecuteEx.
<br>Remarks
<br>This command is similar to open, but it allows you to use file association
information to run the application.
<p><b>shell</b>
<br>The shell command specifies a default command for the drive's context
menu.
<p>shell=verb
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Parameters
<br>verb
<br>The verb that corresponds to the command. The verb and its associated
command must be defined in the Autorun.inf file with a shell/verb command.
<br>Remarks
<br>When a user right-clicks the drive icon, a context menu will appear.
If an Autorun.inf file is present, the default context menu command is
taken from it. This command is also executed when the user double-clicks
the drive's icon.
<p>To specify the default context menu command, first define its verb,
command string, and menu text with shell/verb. Then use shell to make it
the default context menu command. Otherwise, the default menu item text
will be "AutoPlay", which will launch the application specified by the
open command.
<p><b>shell\verb</b>
<br>The shell\verb command adds a custom command to the drive's context
menu.
<p>shell\verb\command=Filename.exe
<br>shell\verb=MenuText
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Parameters
<br>verb
<br>The command's verb. The shell\verb\command command associates the verb
with an executable file. Verbs must not contain embedded spaces. By default,
verb is the text that is displayed in the context menu.
<br>Filename.exe
<br>The path and file name of the application that performs the command.
<br>MenuText
<br>This parameter specifies the text that is displayed in the context
menu. If it is omitted, verb is displayed. MenuText can be mixed-case and
may contain spaces. You can set a shortcut key for the menu item by putting
an ampersand (&amp;) in front of the letter.
<br>Remarks
<br>When a user right-clicks the drive icon, a context menu will appear.
Adding shell/verb commands to the drive's Autorun.inf file allows you to
add commands to this context menu.
<p>There are two parts to this command, which must be on separate lines.
The first part is shell/verb/command, and is required. It associates a
string, called a verb, with the application to be launched when the command
is run. The second part is the shell/verb command, and is optional. It
can be included to specify the text that is displayed in the context menu.
<p>To specify a default context menu command, define the verb with shell/verb,
and make it the default command with shell.
<p>The following sample Autorun.inf fragment associates the readit verb
with the command string "Notepad abc\readme.txt". The menu text is "Read
Me", and 'M' is defined as the item's shortcut key. When the user selects
this command, the drive's abc\readme.txt file will be opened with Notepad.
<p>shell\readit\command=notepad abc\readme.txt
<br>shell\readit=Read &amp;Me
