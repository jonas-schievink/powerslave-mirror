drives are
not really dirty, and cleaning it will
not fix the problem. What the problem is, they are getting out of
adjustment or just getting weak, or the laser quit working.

<span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">1. Use a standard CD/DVD
Cleaner, they look like a normal CD but
with two miniature brushes on them. This will only clean the lens.
Sometimes this is all you need to be up and running. </span><br

<span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">3. Clean the lens and mirror
manually.&nbsp; You will have to take the DVD drive apart.&nbsp; You'll
see the Lense and<br>
Mirror when you do.<br>
</span><br>
<span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">4. Adjust the Potentiometer
(pot) on the laser.&nbsp; This adjusts the strength of the laser, and
is located somewhere along the ribbon cable circuit, not on the cable
itself, but from the board to the lense assembly.<br>
<br>
</span><span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">5. Replace the Laser in
the DVD drive, by purchasing a replacement.&nbsp; This can cost the
same as just buying a replacement drive on Ebay, and takes a LOT longer
to do.&nbsp; I wouldn't bother, but if you want the experience and
satisfaction of doing it this way, be my guest.<br>
<br>
The reason you "sometimes" get the Error, and sometimes not, is because
some games (small) are on CD (Single Layer) media, and the good games
are on DVD Media, and some (Large games) on DVD Dual Layer media.&nbsp;
The laser may be able to read the CD or maybe a Single layer DVD, but
not read through to the 2nd layer of DL media.&nbsp; For example: The
double disk of Jet Set Radio Future and Sega GT 2003 is a CD, while
Halo or Halo II are on a Dual Layer DVD.&nbsp; Anything larger than
4.5GB is going to be DL Media.<br>

<span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Replacing the drive is the
only real fix for the problem. You can open
your Xbox up, remove the drive, open the drive and clean the lens and
mirror. You need compressed air for the mirror. </span><br

are the Thompson, and the Philips.<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">While playing a game you modded -</span>
It came up on unsigned code were it was expected, like with Halo map
modding.&nbsp; Use the encryptomatic signature tool to resign any maps
you patched.<br>
