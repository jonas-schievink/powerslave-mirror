<br>
<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">XboxMediaCenter</span></big> is
another "unsigned" appliction that is free and an open source
multimedia player for the Xbox. Currently&nbsp; XboxMediaCenter can be
used to play/view most popular video/audio/picture formats such as
MPEG-1/2/4, DivX, XviD, MP3, AAC, JPG, GIF plus many more less known
formats directly from a CD/DVD in Xbox DVD-ROM drive or of the Xbox
harddrive, XBMC can also play files from a PC over a local network and
even stream media streams directly from the internet. <br>
<br>
XBMC has playlist and slideshow functions, a weather forecast and many
audio visualizations. All these features enable the Xbox running&nbsp;
to fully function as a multimedia jukebox. XBMC is easy to use, it's
convenient, flexible and offers great price/performance ratio. (This,
The XboxMediaCenter Project&nbsp; is also known as "Xbox Media Center"
or simply "XBMC"). Note! <br>
<br>
XBMC is a hobby project that is only developed by volunteers in their
spare-time for free. (Remember that XboxMediaCenter does require
a&nbsp; modded Xbox to run on or it will not function).<br>
