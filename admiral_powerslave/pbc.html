 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: tahoma;"><big>INSTALLING A
POWER BUTTON IN YOUR CONTROLLER-S</big></big><br>
<br>
<big style="font-weight: bold;"><big>What you will need:</big></big><br>
<br>
1. Submini Pushbutton Switch: Radio Shack Part# 275-1571<br>
2. Wire - .32 guage/Wirewrap wire - I used the wire from an ATA-66 IDE
Cable<br>
3. Solder (Rosin Core) - Thin<br>
4. Soldering Pensil - 15/20 Watt<br>
6. Phillips Screwdriver (Smaller shaft to fit in Controller holes)<br>
7. Drill &amp; Bit&nbsp; (I used a Torx-20 to ream the hole out, then
another Phillips Driver to ream out the rest)<br>
8. Patience!&nbsp; Take your time and do it right.<br>
<br>
If you are using an Original (large) xbox controller, the instructions
for the switch mounting are slighly different, and are included. When
you get to Step 10, go down and look at the drill/mount instructions
for the regular controller.<br>
<br>
<br>
<big style="font-weight: bold;">STEPS:</big><br>
1. Open the Xbox console (voiding your warranty).<br>
<br>
2. Unplug the yellow connector that has ten yellow wires that come from
the front panel, to the plug. This is the plug in the bottom of the
picture.&nbsp; They are all roughly in the same spot on all the other
motherboards.&nbsp; There are only 10 pins on the plug.&nbsp; The other
12-pin plugs you will see on the V1.2 and up, are the USB controller
connectors.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; V1.0 - 1.1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; V1.2 -
1.5&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; V1.6+<br>
<img alt="" src="graphics/v1011powbhead.jpg"
 style="width: 120px; height: 197px;"> &nbsp;<img alt=""
 src="file:///I:/xboxsite/graphics/v12pannel.jpg"
 style="width: 159px; height: 198px;"> &nbsp;<img alt=""
 src="file:///I:/xboxsite/graphics/v16pannel.jpg"
 style="width: 151px; height: 199px;">&nbsp; <br>
The pin at the bottom left of the 10-pin plug is the Power Sense
pin.&nbsp; The second one over is Eject.<br>
<br>
3. Choose which port you will use the modified controller in, and
disconnect it's yellow wire from the mainboard or usb daugter board
(V1.0).&nbsp; In the picture below, is a V1.0-1.1 with the USB daughter
board.&nbsp; Controller ports one and two are on the left side.&nbsp; I
used port #2.&nbsp; You can see two black objects in the picture.&nbsp;
The one on the right is controler port #2.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; V1.0&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; V1.1-V1.5&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; V1.6+<br>

<br>
<br>
4. On that header with the ten yellow wires, the wire to the bottom
left is the power button lead.&nbsp; Solder the yellow wire from your
chosen port onto that yellow wire.&nbsp; You can strip back some wire,
or cut and spice them all together.&nbsp; Do not use the second on over
from the bottom left, that is the Eject wire.&nbsp; Or, if you can,
follow where the the yellow wires go to the pannel.&nbsp; Solder the
yellow wire to the second solder point up from the bottom.&nbsp; I
spliced mine in with the actual wire from the plug.<br>
<br>
5. Verify connectivity on wires, then plug the header back in, and
reassemble the Xbox console.<br>
<br>
6. Open up the controller you wish to modify.<br>
<br>
7. Find a nice place to mount your new button (on the back near the
middle is good), somewhere where you wont bump it accidentally. Make
sure it will fit under the plastic and still fit back together
afterwards!&nbsp; You can remove the rumble motors and put the button
up through the top as well.<br>
<br>
8. Disconnect the yellow wire from the controller, and connect it to
one of the terminals of the button, you may need to extend the wire to
it.&nbsp; <br>
The yellow wire is the 4th one down from the top:
RED-LTGRY-DRKGRY-YLW-BLK-SHIELD:<br>
<img alt="" src="graphics/s-contboard.jpg"
 style="width: 320px; height: 240px;"><br>
<br>
9. Connect a length of wire from the other terminal of the button to
ground.&nbsp; This would be the sheath (shield) or black wire of the
controller cable.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the opposite side of the board from
the above picture, there are two ground points at the BOTTOM:<br>
<img alt="" src="graphics/s-contgnds.jpg"
 style="width: 320px; height: 240px;"><br>
<br>
10. Drill a hole and mount the button by however is necessary (glue
etc).&nbsp; I chose the center screw on the bottom shell. I drilled the
center screw point on the controller:<br>
<img alt="" src="graphics/s-type-drillout.jpg"
 style="width: 320px; height: 240px;"><br>
<br>
11. Reassemble the controller and plug it into the modified port on the
Xbox and test your button!<br>
<br>
</span><span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);" class="font">Remember
the power button on the controller will only work in the port you
modified.<br>
<br>
It may take a while to get the case and everything to go back together
and you may have a little resistance putting controller back
together.&nbsp; I did, but it all went back together ok.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Here is my Controller-S completed:<br>
<img alt="" src="graphics/s-typepow.jpg"
 style="width: 320px; height: 240px;"><br>
</span><span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">You can see the RED
power button right there in the center of the controller!<br>
<br>
I had to melt away the recieving screw tower part under it.<br>
<br>
You may need to cut away some of the circuit board on the controller as
well.&nbsp; There are two traces in the vacinity, but most of all a
ground area:<br>
<img alt="" src="graphics/s-contboard.jpg"
 style="width: 320px; height: 240px;">&nbsp;
<img alt="" src="graphics/s-contboard-z.jpg"
 style="width: 320px; height: 240px;"><br>
There are two copper traces to the left, and right, that head up to the
white plug.&nbsp; You can cut that whole section of the board out,
right to those traces without causing any damage to the other side, ad
it is all one ground area, as shown on the right picture.&nbsp; There
you see you have no traces or circuit to worry about on that side. <br>
<br>

 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: tahoma;"><big>USING THE
ORIGINAL XBOX CONTROLLER</big></big><br>
<br>
Since the back and start buttons are down at the bottom of the
controller, you can't cut those parts out as shown abov, so, this is
what you do:<br>
<img alt="" src="graphics/powercon-reg.jpg"
 style="width: 544px; height: 193px;"><br>
<br>
Drill or ream out the bottom side of the controller, the same size as
the threads of the submini switch.&nbsp; The receiving screw tower on
the other side of the controller has to be removed completely.&nbsp; <br>
<img alt="" src="graphics/reg-type-drillout.jpg"
 style="width: 515px; height: 167px;"><br>
If the size is just right, you can screw in the submini switch, and not
have to use the nut.&nbsp; The "neck" means the threads.<br>
<br>
This is what it would look like fiished:<br>
