<br>
Trainers allow you to cheat in games by patching memory with custom
code values.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
For instanmce, we know (so they say at Bungie) there are no CHEAT CODES
for HALO or HALO II, but there is a TRAINER for Halo II.&nbsp; This
will allow Infinate shield, Infinate ammo with no reoload, rapid fire
mode, No 1 hit Sniper kills, and Invincibility.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Trainers do the same thing as cheat codes in most cases, except the
game loads with them already on, so to speak.&nbsp; In fact, they are
called TRAINERS because when developiong a game, they are used so the
developer can go through a complete "walk through" of the game to be
sure it works, and is free of bugs. <br>
<br>
IF a trainer says "HaloII +13" that means there are 13 different
cheats/options to activate in the trainer.<br>
<br>
So far, Trainers work automatically with the EvolutionX 3935 revision
dashboard.&nbsp;&nbsp; As long as you have the trainers stored as
C:\TRAINERS on the Xbox HDD, it will show up on the
Dashboard.&nbsp;&nbsp; You cannot use these trainers with an Action
Replay! They are not save games, and&nbsp; no one ever said they were!
SO that means you can't&nbsp; load them to your memory card.. They,
again, are NOT saves.<br>
<br>
Usually, you can not use NTSC trainers with PAL games and vice
versa.&nbsp; Some trainers do support both, and they will indicate that
with "NTSC/PAL."&nbsp; Setting your Xbox region to a PAL region does
not change the game from NTSC to PAL. It changes the video mode (which
can screw you bigtime), and not the code of the game.&nbsp; If you are
using a PAL copy of a game with a NTSC trainer nothing will happen (in
regards to the trainer) if you switch your video mode to NTSC.<br>
<br>
You can not use trainers on Xbox Live, no those cheaters are NOT using
trainers, so leave it at that!<br>
<br>
A trainer file ends in .ETM - any other file in an Archive or with the
trainer does NOT have to go into the Trainers folder.<br>
<br>
You can edit the trainer with EvoX, turn on options, then turn on the
Trainer, then Exit and Save.&nbsp; When you boot the game from the EvoX
Dashboard, the trainer is used for that game.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Will This Permanently Hack The Game?&nbsp; No, Just that one time.<br>
<br>
Before We begin, There's somethings you have to be aware of and do.
First, go to System Utils and go to the "TSR"<br>
option, switch it to Normal, now choose "Save and Exit". Now that's
what's needed to be done, now here's what you must know:<br>
<br>
1.&nbsp; DO NOT EVER HAVE ON MORE THAN ONE TRAINER AT A TIME, DOING SO
CAN CAUSE THE TRAINER NOT TO WORK AND THE GAME TO CRASH.<br>
2.&nbsp; ALWAYS TURN ON THE "ENABLE" TRAINER TO USE A TRAINER,
OTHERWISE THE TRAINER WILL NOT WORK.<br>
3.&nbsp; ALWAYS MAKE SURE YOU "SAVE AND EXIT" WHEN YOU'RE READY TO USE
THE TRAINER, OTHERWISE THE TRAINER WON'T BE ENABLED.<br>
4.&nbsp; ONLY BOOT GAMES FROM THE "EVOX 3935" DASHBOARD IN ORDER TO USE
A TRAINER.<br>
