You will have to make a regular PC power connector, and rig up a
push-button Eject (momentaty contact) switch.<br>

</span><span class="font"><span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Also
note that Windows must be able to detect your
Xbox DVD drive. Some Xbox drives, Philips, seem to be not
detectable by Windows.&nbsp; </span><span

detected you can use a software tool to unlock the drive to read
original DVDXBOX discs.<br>

</span></span><span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);" class="font">This
"TOOL" unlocks an original Xbox DVD-ROM drive,
while attached to a PC.&nbsp; Now you can access an original DVDXBOX
disc from PC using tools like Clone CD.&nbsp; Note that it will report
many bad sectors, that's
normal.&nbsp; Now can can copy games without having to FTP to your
modded Xbox.<br>
<br>
The DVD Drive from the Xbox is always a SLAVE device.<br>
<br>
<big><big><span style="font-weight: bold;">MY TEST:</span></big></big><br>
I powered on Xbox, put a DISC in, then powered off.<br>
Removed the IDE Cable and plugged it into a PC As SLAVE on Primary w/HDD<br>
Powered on Xbox, LED Blinks RED AND GREEN<br>
Powered on the PC<br>
My PC Recognized mine as "THOMPSON-DVD 1.4"<br>
Bios did search all three DVD drives for a boot disc (Was two)<br>
I did not find it in Win Explorer, or in the Device Manager.<br>
Was able to use the EJECT button on the Xbox to Open/Close the Tray<br>
IDE Activity light on PC was solid RED, but HDD access still worked -
Disc always was spun-up.<br>
Unlocker did not find it.<br>
Tried again, placed XboxDVD Drive on Secondary IDE by itself - Disk
always spinning.<br>
Was able to use the Xbox EJECT button to Open/Close tray <br>
Can see IDE Activity light when oprning/closing the tray - Tries to
read the disc.<br>
Did not see a DVD drive in Win Explorer or the Device Manager<br>
Did a RESCAN for Plug-n-Play hardware - found nothing.<br>
Put in aVCD - Spun up, and then spun down - Game disc kept it spun-up.<br>
Audio CD also kept it Spun Up.<br>
Put in a DVD-R Movie - Stayed Spun Up.<br>
Rebooted with a DVD Movie in - BIOS sees it - Attempts Boot from the
drive - Still nothing in WinXP.<br>
Put a WinXP install disc in - Spun Down - Rebooted to see if the PC
would boot from it.<br>
Did not boot from the CD - Drive stayed Spun up. <br>
Changed position on IDE Cable, still no recognition in WinXP.<br>
Could not manually install a DVD Drive from the control pannel.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">THIS DID NOT WORK FOR ME!!!</span><br>

 style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><big style="font-weight: bold;">ALTERNATE
WAY TO CONNECT TO PC</big><br>
<br>
Easiest to test this is probably to connect the IDE cable of your Xbox
DVD drive to your PC, while keeping the 12-pin cable for power/eject
connected from the Xbox mainboard, to the Xbox DVD drive as normal.<br>
<br>
PC is off at this point.<br>
<br>
Power on the Xbox, place a game disc into the DVD drive, then power it
off.&nbsp; Remove the IDE cable from the Xbox to the DVD drive, then
connect the IDE cable from a PC into the DVD drive, then power Xbox on.
<br>
<br>
When you power up the XBOX, while the IDE cable is in the PC, you will
get Error 11, which is NO DVD found.&nbsp; The power to the DVD drive
will/should still be there, you just won't be able to eject the tray,
but the disc is in the drive.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Turn on your PC and see if it detects the drive, then run the tool.<br>
<br>

not, and will not test this new tool, as I have no problems making
backups the traditional way, it just takes longer.<br>
