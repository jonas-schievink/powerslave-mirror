</span><small>So, you damaged your mainboard while installing your
MODCHIP?&nbsp; Well, don't get too upset, you can fix it, and it's not
all that hard.&nbsp; First of all, you should only be using a 35watt
soldering iron, and thin rosin core solder, like 24guage size.<br>
<br>
Damage to the traces and/or pads are usually due to excessive heat,
that is, heat kept on the trace or pad too long, or the soldering iron
is too hot (more than 35watts).&nbsp;&nbsp; The other way they become
pulled up or damaged, is if you are putting tension on the wire you are
soldering to the pad, and the pad lifts up as the solder
cools.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
The thing with pads being lifted or damaged, is there is a connection
on the bottom side of the mainboard through that pad. If the pad is
unrepairable, you can simply jumper to the other side of the mainboard
as well.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
The LPC bus is no different, it consists of pads and traces leading to
those pads.&nbsp; VISIBLE traces can always be replaced with jumper
wire.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>
Traces in the middle of, three, or more layered mainboards, can't be
fixed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Most PC motherboards today are more than two
layers.&nbsp; As far as I know, the Xbox mainboard is a four layer
board.&nbsp; You can only fix what you can see.<br>
</small><br>
<small>The images below show many different methods of running jumpers,
and under what conditions they're run.&nbsp; All the pictures below can
help you repair a bad or broken trace or pad.&nbsp; <big

&nbsp;is taken.<br>
<br>
<img style="WIDTH: 200px;

This method of trace repair to the component<br>
is also acceptable, and is how most modchip<br>
jumper wires are conencted, as a parallel <br>
connection, to the resistor of the Eject LED.<br>
<br>
<br>
<big>Note:</big>&nbsp; Say this part, a resistor, was damaged.&nbsp;
We'll also say current flows from<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the
left side, through to the right.&nbsp; You would solder a jumper, with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; the same
vaule resistor in the jumper, and then solder to the RIGHT<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; side of the
resistor in the picture.&nbsp; Then you would then cut the trace just <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
before the LEFT side, to assure there is no future short or connection,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as
that would PARALLEL your jumper.&nbsp; You can also solder one<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lead
of the added resistor directly to the RIGHT side, then the jumper wire<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; from the other lead of the
added resistor to the originaing pad or trace.<br>

you can solder a jumper to the leg.&nbsp; This also<br>
works if you had to clip the leg or the leg broke<br>
off, and there is a piece left to solder a jumper <br>
to, it would just be a smaller area.&nbsp; It is not <br>
recommended you go up OVER the component,<br>
as heat will eventually damage the jumper.<br>

can occur with heat damaged, and/or lifted pads and traces to other

jumper wires in an XY manner as directly as feasible, with as few bends

hole, where you are only using it as a shortcut to the other side of
the mainboard, further insulate the wire.&nbsp; You can drill the
plating out if it is not a ground point, or are no traces leading to it.<br>
<img style="WIDTH: 200px;
 HEIGHT: 133px" alt ="" src="diagrams/throughsleeve.gif" ><br>
The above represantation is also like the holes in the LPC bus, and
other solder pads on the main board, they're just smaller.&nbsp; The
solder flows from the soldered side, to the other; which in turn
connects all traces that end up at the pad, both top, bottom, and any
layers in between.&nbsp;&nbsp; So you can see why damaging a pad can
effect anything that is connected to it.&nbsp; <br>

</span></big>SOLDER WIC is the best thing to use to soak up Solder in a
pinch. <br>
You place the solder WIC on the solder, apply the iron to the WIC, and<br>
the solder is soaked up by the WIC.<br>
<br>
Experienced users use what is called a "Solderpolt" that sucks up the
solder.<br>
It is a PLUNGER action tube - you push down the plunger, heat the
solder while<br>
the nozzle is by it, press the button, and Thoomp, the solder is sucked
up.<br>
<br>
A Desolder Gun/Iron has a vacuum tube, like a surgeon uses suction
during<br>
an operation.&nbsp; The solder is vacuumed up as you apply heat and
melt it.<br>

The PIC16LC63A microcontroller is responsible for handling the Xbox's
power such as powering the unit on, sending the eject signal to the DVD
drive and powering down/resetting the unit.<br>
<br>
IF you have repaired the power supply and Xbox still does not respond,
this may be the problem.<br>
<br>
Note: if you have a 1.6 motherboard and the unit does not boot up after
doing work on the motherboard then it is most likely because the
standby power regulator transistor has blown. If this is the case you
need the MMBT3906LT1-D transistor. checkout.<br>
