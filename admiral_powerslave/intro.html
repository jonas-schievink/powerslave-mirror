copying xbox games is illegal, and so
on.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
If you are modding the Xbox to PIRATE hundereds of
games, <br>
then you WILL need to buy the following equipment, supplies, <br>
and
get person, and think like a dolt(s): <br>

be ruled illegal as a circumvention device per the DCMA (Digital

<small>Do your homework, and look for a chip that comes with a BIOS
Already flashed.&nbsp; Ok, as of 6/25/2005,<br>
<a href="http://www.console24.com">http://www.console24.com</a> sells
mod chips with an EvoX Bios already flashed.&nbsp; That is where I got
my Aladdin Advance chip.&nbsp; They were selling the Aladdin Extreme as
of this paragraph.&nbsp; Look for </small></big></span><strong

????????</em></strong><span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"> (in
some Countrys illegal!)" in the decription or specifications!&nbsp;
The?-Marks represent the version of the Non Standard BIOS that is on
the chip.<br>
<br>
There is no reason you can't search Google and find a reseller that
will put a BIOS on the chip.&nbsp; Hint?&nbsp; Don't buy from a USA
retailer, because they will most certainly NOT come with the Non
Standard BIOS.<br>
<br>
</span><span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"
 class="newspagesummarytext"><big><br style="font-weight: bold;">
</big><span style="font-weight: bold;"><big><big>Now, for the Serious
modder:</big></big><br>
</span>Xbox mod chips allow you to run unsigned
code by overriding the default
Microsoft BIOS that comes with your Xbox when you purchased it.&nbsp;
Modding also great for making your system 100% portable!&nbsp; You can
store games and DVD movies on the hard disk and take it with
you.&nbsp;&nbsp; No packing up DVDs or game discs!<br>
<br>
<big style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
<big>What you need to know (Basic knowledge):</big></big><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Standard B</span><big><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">IOS</span></big> (Basic Input
Output System) is
the program in the chip that starts up your Xbox and communicates
between the
devices in the xbox such as the hard drive and graphics card. The BIOS
is extremely important to your Xbox system. An xbox mod chip replaces
the default Microsoft BIOS with its own "hacked" BIOS. The hacked BIOS
will allow you to run unauthorized programs.&nbsp; The Xbox is,
basically, a <span style="font-weight: bold;">non-legacy PC</span>,
you can look that up.&nbsp; The XBOX bios requires the HDD to be
locked, with a stored password, before execution of any code; a
security measure.&nbsp; This locking prevents access to the drive when
removed, powered off, or intialized.&nbsp;&nbsp; The standard bios also
checks for an electronic signature (protection) in the program(s)
before executing any code from the HDD or DVD drive.<br>
<br>
<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cromwell Bios</span>:</big> Most
mod chips today are shipped with some version of the Cromwell Bios,
which is a totally legal bios that was not designed with any
infringement of, or copyrighted Microsoft code. When you boot your
Xbox, with a mod chip enabledthat has a Cromwell Bios installed, you
are overriding the Microsoft Xboxs Bios.&nbsp; The Cromwell bios is
often used as a starting point for installing another bios.&nbsp; Many
Xbox modders mod their xbox solely for the purpose of installing Linux.
In this case, Cromwell is perfect because with it you can get complete
control over the xbox boot process, allowing you to turn your Xbox into
a Linux-only machine. With the Cromwell bios you can repartition and
format the hard disk completely for Linux, and erase all traces of the
original Xbox bios. <br>
<br>
<big style="font-weight: bold;">Non Standard Bios</big>:&nbsp; These
bioses, known as EvoX_M series, Executor, and so on, allow the xbox to
boot past all&nbsp; Microsoft's security checks, both on the HDD and
DVD drives.&nbsp; They allow the execution of what is called non-signed
code, which is another security measure to be sure it is a Microsoft
Liscensed product.&nbsp; The bios also allows booting of backups on DVD
and some CDRs (if apllication/game small enough) media.&nbsp; Booting
of a backup with the original bios will fail 100% of the time, there is
no way around it.&nbsp; Altering the contents of the HDD without a mod
chip will fail, unless the O/S is explioted (soft modded).. <br>
<br style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Dashboard:</span></big> An Xbox
"dashboard" is what you see when your Xbox boots up without a
disc in the dvd-rom drive. It's the GUI (graphical user interface) you
see. When you install an alternate dashboard, like EvolutionX, then you
are installing an alternate interface, with lots of additional
features. The
menu setup on most of alternate dashboards can be configured so that it
features, tools, and utilities that you can add to your modded Xbox to
be
run. In some ways, you could think of the dashboard as your Xbox's
operating system, like Windows is on your home PC.&nbsp; Most alternate
dashboards come with built-in FTP servers. An FTP server is necessary
so that you can connect your computer to your Xbox -via- networking to
transfer files bank and forth.<br>
<br>
<big><big style="font-weight: bold;">Facts:&nbsp;</big></big> <br>
You can not use a PC to copy Xbox Games, the Xbox DVD drive and
firmware configuration are different, and are modified to read
discs backwards.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
You can not place pull the OEM HDD in a PC to copy or alter the
contents, you won't get anywhere with a locked HDD.<br>
<br>
Companies that sell software that say you can copy XBOX games to CDR is
false, do not even bother.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Once the HDD unlocked, you can use the PC to explore the Xbox HDD with
a special
driver/software package, but you can not copy it.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
It used to be that you had to have some kind of&nbsp; hardware to
modify the Xbox, that is no longer true - SOFTMODDING can now be
done.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
You can not backup, play backups or offshore titles without a modded
Xbox.&nbsp; <br>
