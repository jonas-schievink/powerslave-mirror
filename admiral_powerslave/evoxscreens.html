<br>
1. Applications do not launch, it freezes at the big &lt;X&gt;
screen.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you installed EvoX from a CD or DVD there is an
issue with the file when it is copied from the DVD directly to the
HDD.&nbsp; What you need to do is, copy the "evoxdash.xbe" to the PCs
hard disk -via- FTP and turn off the READ ONLY attributes.&nbsp; Put it
back on the Xbox HDD and try again.&nbsp; I have had this problem and
doing this has worked.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a program called
"attributes.xbe" that is supposed to fix this problem, and can be
launched from the DVD EvoX's menu.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the "evoxdash.xbe"
&amp; files are fixed it should work fine.<br>
<br>
2. I.P. Adresses &amp; Routers!&nbsp; It seems some people have
problems with connecting -via- FTP with EvoX.&nbsp; I have had the same
problem when the EvoX INI file has a Static IP address that does not ,
for a lack of a better word, conform with the Router's DHCP
table.&nbsp; Example: I could not connect to an Xbox behind my router
with an IP address of 192.168.1.115, but could connect to the Xbox with
an IP address of 192.158.0.115 though.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Who knows, but
my router's IP address is 192.168.0.1 so the routing table is based on
192.168.0.XXX IP addresses.&nbsp; I think the ISSUE is, that if you
have a router, then your Xbox's IP must be within its routing
table.&nbsp; <br>
