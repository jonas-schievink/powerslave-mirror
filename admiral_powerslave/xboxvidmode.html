TO NTSC</big></big><br>
<big>Using Xbox Media Center (XBMC)<br>
<br>
It depends on the sections you have activated/hidden in the config.xml
in your main menu. For example if you use the TV-Guide you have to move
down 3 times.<br>
<br>
If you have accidentally changed your video to PAL or your video mode
got changed to PAL somehow, here is how to fix it with XBMC.<br>
<br>
1. Start xbmp (from manu, or boot DVD/cdrw for example)<br>
2. press down 2 times (using dpad or remote control) to move to the
settings menu.&nbsp; 3 times if you have the TV-Guide option active.<br>
3. press A to get into the settings menu<br>
4. press down 5 times to get select the video menu<br>
5. press A to get into the video menu<br>
6. press right to select the ' tv standard' control<br>
7. press right to select the up control<br>
8. press A this will select the NTSC-M standard<br>
9. press down 3 times to select the SET button<br>
10. press A to hit the button<br>
<br>
Your box should be NTSC again<br>

The best way is to burn a "Enigmah Video Mode Switch Disc", boot from
it and press "B" (NTSC) or "A" (Pal) and reboot. <br>
<br>
I could not find a way within the M$Dash to set the video mode.&nbsp; I
went to settings, and video mode, but all there is, is the screen
settings, and nothing else.<br>
<br>
You can also buy an Adapter to go between the XBox and TV.<br>
<br>
There is almost NO information on changing video modes, and nothing at
all for doing it with the M$dash.&nbsp; All I could find was using the
Enigma video switcher.<br>
<br>
You can put that in your APPS directory on Xbox -via- FTP.&nbsp; If you
can select it from the APPS menu, then you simply need to execute it,
and press "B" for NTSC or "A" for PAL and reboot.<br>
<br>
Changing video modes can now get you banned on Xbox live.<br>
