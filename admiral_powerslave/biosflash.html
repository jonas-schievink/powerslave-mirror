</big>Some mod chips come with a bios image already on them, called the
Cromwell bios. The Cromwell bios is there to allow you to be able to
turn on your Xbox, and be able to flash a bios image of your choice
onto the mod chip, without the need for hardware programmers.<br>
<br>
Newer mod chips such as the Xenium, SmartXX and Xecuter3, feature their
own form of operating system. This allows you to have even greater
control when flashing your mod chip with a new bios, as well as having
many useful features on them as well. <br>
<br>
<big style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
BIOS Banks Explained</big><br>
Mod chips have a chip on them called a "flash rom". This varies in size
from mod chip to mod chip. The bigger the size, the more different bios
images, or more complex bios images, you can put on there. The original
Xbox bios is 256kb in size, so most mod chips divide their flash rom up
into multiples of 256kb. Most mod chips will allow you to have
different sized bios images on the flash rom however, but they are
always multiples of 256kb. For example, your mod chip may have a 1mbit
flash rom on it. That would mean you could have one 1mbit bios image on
there, or two 512kb bios images on there, or four 256kb bios images on
there. It depends on what you want type of bios you want to use on the
mod chip. Remember though, you MUST always flash a bios bank with bios
image that matches its size. So if the bank is 256kb, it must be
flashed with a 256kb bios image, or else it won't work properly. </span><span

<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Flashing Using Cromwell</span></big><br>
If your mod chip has the Cromwell bios on it, you will be presented
with a screen when you first turn your Xbox on with your mod chip
installed. The Cromwell bios screen will normally wait a few moments,
then prompt you to insert a CD with a new bios image on it. When you do
this, it will reflash the current bios bank it is using, with the one
you have put on the CD. Once it has finished flashing, it will reboot
the Xbox using the new bios image. After doing that you will be able to
put new applications on the Xbox, such as a replacement dashboard, or
play a backed up game. <br>
<br>
<big style="font-weight: bold;">Flashing Using Onboard Operating System</big><br>
Mod chips like the Xenium, SmartXX, X-Chip and Xecuter 3, all use their
own onboard operating system. These are a bit like dashboards in a way.
They will allow you to perform many different tasks, one of which will
be flashing the mod chip. The onboard operating systems on these mod
chips will ask you to locate a bios image you wish to flash with, which
can be on the hard drive or on a CD. It will then flash the mod chip
with the selected bios.<br>
<br>
<big><big style="font-weight: bold;">Troubleshooting:</big></big><br>
A bad flash can occur at any time, and for no reason. The most common
reason for it is flashing a bios bank with a bios image that is the
wrong size. It can also be caused by a corrupt bios bank, or a bad
connection between the mod chip and the Xbox. <br>
<br>
<big style="font-weight: bold;">Recovering With A Programmer</big><br>
Most mod chips have a programmer unit that is either supplied with the
mod chip when it is sold, or available seperately at a later date.
Chips that have hardware programmers include: Matrix, Chameleon,
Xecuter2.0-2.6.&nbsp; Recovering from a bad flash with a hardware
programmer is very straight forward. Simply take the chip out of the
Xbox, or if it has a long enough cable, leave it in the Xbox (make sure
its switched off), and connect it to your programmer. Plug the
programmer into your PC (normally on the LPT/Printer Port), and load up
the software from the makers of your mod chip, and flash the bank with
a new bios image. It is always important to make sure you flash a bank
with the correct sized bios image. Eg if the bank is 256kb, flash it
with a 256kb bios image.<br>
<br>
<big style="font-weight: bold;">Recovering With A USB Programmer</big><br>
Some chips feature USB support, which allows them to be flashed using
your PC via a USB connection. The chips that support this to date are
the X-B.I.T v1.0/1.5 and the X-Chip.<br>
These can be reflashed by connecting the chip to the PC via a USB
cable. Then load up the software from your mod chip manufacturer, and
relfash the bank with a correctly sized bios image.<br>
<br>
<big style="font-weight: bold;">Recovering By Using A Different Bank</big><br>
If your mod chip is setup so it's using more than one bank, you can
simply switch to a bank that either still has Cromwell on it, or has a
working bios image. From there you can then use software on the Xbox to
reflash the bad bank. Some mod chips allow you to switch banks via
software control on the Xbox, but others may require you to physically
change the dip switches on the mod chip to change the bank you're
flashing to. <br>
<br>
<big style="font-weight: bold;">Recovering With Another Modchip (Hot
Swap)</big><br>
If you have another mod chip which has a working bios image on it, you
can use it to reflash your other mod chip. To do this you will need to
boot up your Xbox with the working mod chip installed, then while the
Xbox is turned on, you will need to install the broken mod chip. You
can then use software on the Xbox to reflash the chip with a working
bios image. <span style="font-style: italic;">Please note: This method
is only recommended for experienced users, as it can easily cause
damage to your Xbox that cannot be repaired. Only mod chips using pin
headers or pogo pins should be used for this.</span><br>
