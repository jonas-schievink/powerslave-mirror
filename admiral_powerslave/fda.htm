</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><P>This organization was the responsible entity for the approval of prescription drugs, and other related items of old Earth.<BR>
The Klingon Empire is not sure of its primary function, due to the approval of so many drugs and chemicals during the period caused side effects that did cause harm the individuals using them.</P>
<P>We do not understand why this "administration" approved so many toxic chemicals as "remedies" when they did, in fact, cause other problems with usage, and some led to further treatment. The agency was the primary cause of many unnecessary deaths in Earth's "Elder" population, with their refusal to provide the necessary means to cure their cancers and other ailments. </P>
<P>We Klingon's respect our Elder warriors, and learn much from them. We do not allow the meaningless deaths of our people. The Government of Earth in that time period let their people die with no honor. Our people meet death with their eyes open, not in a hospital bed.</P>
<P>You may not believe in our practices either, but if an elder warrior wished die an honorable death, they simply challenged another Klingon to do battle, a duel you might say, and die fighting, honorably!. If born with a Klingon heart, always will you be - KLINGON. Our criminals are the only Kliginons who die with dishonor, as they committed a dishonorable act.</P>

<B><P>Examples:</P>
</B><P>Asthma patients were given a variety of medications from vapor form breathed in, to pill form taken with food or drink. These medications caused other side effects that hindered their immune systems while using the medication. They could die from a simple infection while on the medication, or under the knife of a surgeon. <BR>
<BR>
Another was for what they called "Acid Reflux Disease" better known as Heartburn. This medication cause abdominal pain, and other side effects. This is not a disease, just a simple problem that could be cured by changing eating habits.</P>
<P>What we do not understand is why the F.D.A. had approved so many of these chemicals, and drugs that did harm the people using them, but not approve other medications and chemicals to improve and/or sustain life?</P>
<P>Allergy medicines also caused much of the same side effects.</P>
<P>There was even a pill that would allow the regrowth of hair. This pill would cause serious birth defects to an impregnated woman who handled the medication. This was insidious! Humans were so vain, they would put these toxins into their bodies just to regrow hair, while any man with a wife, who was pregnant would risk their child born with defects. </P>
<B><P><BR>
Our Conclusion?</P>
</B><P>We believe it was an on-going crusade to rid Earth of the weak, and weary. Although we also do not believe in a "weak, and weary" Klingon, they are never put to slow deaths. They are valued as experienced people, and they are taken care of for the feats!</P>
<P>We also understand the burden that the "elder" population placed on the Federal Government in supporting them with their old Social Security, but the working class of the time paid for all of that. Where did the resources go? Most went to Defense, and military causes, while others funds were squandered in their relations with other countries of the time.</P>
<P>Their solution was to let the people die, dishonorably, rather than to cure or help them. The people and their vanity allowed the Government to put them to death in this manner.</P>
<P>The United States was founded on War, Greed, and Dishonor, how would you expect the people to act?</P>
<P>The Federation saved all if their lives, and in, as you put it "in the nick of time."</P></BODY>
