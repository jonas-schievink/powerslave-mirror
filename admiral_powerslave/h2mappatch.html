<br>
<big style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE:</big><br>
Always make a backup of your original maps!<br>
You need a modded xbox for this!&nbsp; You should have Halo 2 on your
HDD!<br>
<br>
1) Now connect with your xbox using ftp, do this by adding your xbox
ip-adress in the adres menu, your username (its in your xbox settings
somewhere) in the username window, and your password (also in settings)
in the pasword window.<br>
* (Normally the username and pasword is just "xbox")<br>
<br>
2) Once you connected to your xbox, look for your F:\ drive or any
other drive where you put your Halo 2 game. Then go into the Halo 2
folder and look for a subfolder called maps.<br>
<br>
3) Transfer the map you need from your xbox to your pc by clicking the
map and move it to your pc (then ftp will auto copy the map.)<br>
<br>
4) Open your donwloaded file, should be a .rar or .zip file (which
means it is compressed), extract it to your pc.<br>
<br>
5) Now you need to open ppf-o-matic. You should see two blank fields.
In the upper you should put the original map (like you took it fro your
xbox) <br>
*To see these maps you have to change it from ISO files --&gt; all
files Exclamation In the lower field you should select your ppf.&nbsp;
Then hit apply.<br>
<br>
6) Now that your map is patched with the mod. You need to "resign" it,
otherwise you get a dirty disc error.&nbsp; Now use the encryptomatic
signature tool, open your map, then after succesfully signed you see a
message which confirms the signing.<br>
<br>
7) Transfer the map back to you xbox (overwrite the old one) from the
PC modded one.<br>
<br>
8 ) Play Halo 2. Sometimes you have to play a different map otherwise
it wont load the modded map, this is easier than clearing the cache
files! <br>
