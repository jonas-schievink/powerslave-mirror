of all, the hardware Mod, basic function is to bypass the onboard
Microsoft BIOS through clever wiring to boot an alternate BIOS. This
allows the XBOX to boot an alternate BIOS located on the modchip such
as an EvoX, or Xecutor2 BIOS. The softmod uses an exploit to trick the
XBOX into loading an alternate BIOS.<br>
</font></font><font color="#ffffff" face="Arial" size="2"><font size="3"><br>
Using a SoftMod, the end result is <b>EXACTLY</b> the same as if a
modchip were installed. The only difference is that there isn't support
for specialized hardware like external LCD screens and such. To the end
user, the only thing noticeable is that it takes about two seconds
longer to start the XBOX.<br>
<br>
</font></font><font color="#ffffff" face="Arial" size="2"><font size="3">The
softmod allows for error and is fully <b>END USER</b> reversable, and
repairable, and uninstallable without a trace. The softmod lets you do
everything a modchip can, including playing DivX, Realmedia, MOV, MP3,
backups, emulators and more,&nbsp; and best of all, won't void your
warranty for opening the unit.<br>
<br>
</font></font><font color="#ffffff" face="Arial" size="2"><font size="3">XBOX
Live can be used fully with the softmod but is not supported. The
onboard chip mod cannot be used in conjunction with Live. However,
there are <b>FREE </b>alternatives available and installed on both
the softmod and onboard chip mod.<br>
<br>
You can't install a NEW, LARGER hard disk with a SoftMod.&nbsp; The new
HDD must be obtained with the SoftMod already installed on it, and the
drive must be lockable.</font></font><a name="_Toc96394628"><br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Why SoftModding&nbsp; Works? </span><small>[Found
during a search]</small></big><br>
Microsoft knows NOW, that a vulnerability within the XBOX dashboard
that could have serious impact. This is underlined by the fact that the
dashboard checks most of its files against an internal stored SHA1 hash
value before it uses them. <br>
<br>
The SHA1 check is not performed on the audio (.wav) and font (.xtf)
files.&nbsp; That means there is an exploitable integer underflow
vulnerabilitiy within the font file loader which can be exploited with
a malformed font file. When the XTF header is processed the dashboards
reads a 4 byte blocksize field from the font file. This is expected to
represent the size of some datablock including the 4 bytes of the size
field itself. The blocksize is then allocated and the sizefield is
copied into the beginning of the buffer. This is already a possible
overflow bug when the field contains the values 0..3.&nbsp; Due to
memory alignment this is not exploitable. But then the blocksize is
decreased by 4 because the dashboard wants to read the rest of the
block into memory. Obviously values of 0..3 will underflow when
decreased by 4 and this results in the dashboard wanting to read up to
~4 gigabytes of data from the font file in a f.e. 3 bytes buffer.<br>
<br>
Because the XBOX malloc()/free() implementation is also storing control
information on inbound data, and is similiar to the Windows 2000/XP
heap allocators, this bug is exploitable and allows execution of
arbitrary code. <br>
<br>
Also, the dashboard loads the font files directly after the XBOX starts
animation. This means the exploit does not need any user interaction
and when the code is executed only part of the dashboard background is
on screen.<br>
<br>
Microsoft was told about this exploit, but has done nothing to correct
it.<br>
<big style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
</big>Other exploits followed such as the "Audio exploit". This was a
safer way to jump-start Linux without needing a game DVD in the drive,
but it required the user to punch a special sequence into the XBox hand
controller, and required that a music CD disc be in the DVD tray.<br>
<br>
<big style="font-weight: bold;">Audio Exploit</big><br>
This Modifications adds software to the XBox hard drive. The exploit
takes advantage of the XBox's audio playing program. The xbox does not
verify that the audio playing programs database is "legitimately
signed" microsoft software. By not doing this, code is implanted inside
the audio player database so that when the program is run and the
database is read, it will begin booting "non-legitimate" signed code.
(This signing is essential to the exploit).&nbsp; When used in
conjunction with the "Phoenix Bios Loader" tool it will cause the XBox
to boot the extracted code from a Modification Chip, replacing the
XBox's onboard bios information until the xbox is powered off.<br>
<br>
<br>
<big style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
PROBLEMS?</big><br>
If the Xbox clock becomes corrupted (unplugged for a few hours), the
Xbox can get stuck in a "reboot loop" whenever it gets powered on. The
various exploits have attempted to solve this "reboot loop" issue with
varying degrees of success.&nbsp; None of the font exploits really fix
the reboot loop issue.<br>
<br>
</font></font><span
 style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: tahoma;">The only way
that I have read that corrects this problem is performing
the swap trick, renaming the font files back temporarily, and setting
the clock with the clock utility.</span><br>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Arial" size="2"><font size="3"><br>
The audio exploit does not suffer from the reboot loop issue.<br>
<br>
</font></font><span
 style="font-family: tahoma; color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">this clock
loop business has been solved by a later release of the Xbox font
exploit files called </span><em
 style="font-family: tahoma; color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Bert &amp;
Ernie Reloaded. </em><span
 style="font-family: tahoma; color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
They resolve this issue by simply hard setting the date of the Xbox
upon every boot. That way the time utility never starts, and you never
begin the clock loop in the first place.</span><br>

<big>GAMES SOFTMODDING SUPPORTS:</big><br>
1. James Bond - Agent Under Fire<br>
2. Splinter Cell<br>
3. Mech Assult - 1st Release<br>
</font></font><strong> </strong><span
 style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><br>
As a general rule, you can't use the Platinum Edition games, but some
have claimed they have gotten it to work.<br>
<br>
<big style="font-weight: bold;">Does it have to be the 4920 Version
dashboard?</big><br>
In short, yes - which is why most softmods come with that versiobn
dashboard.&nbsp; This is what also causes some Errors like 13, 16, and
21.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also?&nbsp; The V1.6+, and V1.7 (If exists) Xbox's dash
CAN NOT be downgraded.<br>
