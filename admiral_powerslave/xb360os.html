<span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">The Xbox 360's OS, in turn,
has its roots in the OS of the original Xbox. It was said that, not by
Microsoft, but by one of its hardware partners, that the Xbox
absolutely positively does NOT run Linux, or Unix or some variant of
that. The Xbox 360 project started with the Xbox OS the same way the
Xbox project started with Windows 2000. They cut, added, and changed it
in both large and small ways. It's now quite a bit different from the
Xbox OS, which was itself quite a bit different from Windows 2000. <br>
<br>
Xbox 360 reportedly runs a second-order derivative of Windows 2000 that
has been ported to the custom triple-core IBM PowerPC processor.<br>
<br>
Microsoft's Chief Software Architect Bill Gates hinted at the
possibility of licensing the Xbox 360 operating system out to 3rd
parties.&nbsp; Xbox 360's operating system would fill a nice medium
ground, cheap but very powerful in specific fields - extremely robust
media playback capabilities and deep networking functionality.<br>
