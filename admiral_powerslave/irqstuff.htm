What are IRQ's and COM Ports?</H2>
<B><FONT SIZE=-1>IRQ</FONT> as is the abbreviation for Interrupt Request.
An IRQ is a request line to the processor to get its attention, letting
the CPU know that I/O is now routing to the device that requested it. A
computer system acknowledges 16 IRQS, numbered 0 through 15. To use certain
devices, the system requires an open IRQ. If two devices try to use the
same IRQ, the system or one of the devices will likely freeze, but there
are some instances where two devices can share an IQR, just not at the
same time. Example, if you have a mouse and a modem on COM1, the mouse
will stop working when the modem is activated. When the modem is closed,
mouse control may return, but that is not guarenteed.</B>

<P><B>COM Ports (short for Communication Ports) are the nine or twenty-five
pin serial channels to the system, requiring the use of an IRQ. A COM Port
is an extension of an IRQ to a device that is not plugged directly into
the bus. Examples of devices that utilize COM ports are mice, modems, scanners,
and serial printers, and barcode scanners. The system will acknowldge up
to 4 COM Ports: COM1, COM2, COM3, and COM4. Each COM port, when in use,
requires its own IRQ. You don't need to enable any COM ports technically,
but typically systems have 2 in use: A serial mouse (usually on COM1) and
modem (Usually on COM2 or COM4).</B>

IRQ Settings</H2>
<B><FONT SIZE=-2>Since the number of available IRQs are limited, they become
a valuable resource. Here is a list of the IRQs and their uses</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=-1>.</FONT>
<DL>
<DT>
<B>IRQ 0</B></DT>

<DD>
System timer interrupt from TIMER-0. No user-definable options.</DD>

<DT>
<B>IRQ 1</B></DT>

<DD>
Keyboard</DD>

<DT>
<B>IRQ 2</B></DT>

<DD>
Cascade for IRQs 8-15. This is like an overlap IRQ for the higher-numbered
IRQs. IRQ 2 is often a link from IRQ 9. For example, a SCSI controller
set to IRQ9 would cascade to IRQ 2.</DD>

<DT>
<B>IRQ 3</B></DT>

<DD>
Available. This IRQ should be used for COM2/COM4. Typically, modems work
well on IRQ 3. Two devices can share the same IRQ if they have different
COM ports. For example, you can have an internal modem set on COM2/IRQ
3, and an external radio-modem or scanner on COM4/IRQ 3. You will not encounter
any IRQ conflict unless you try to operate both devices simultaneously.
For this reason, do not share the IRQ you use for the mouse, since the
mouse is used so often.</DD>

<DIR>
<DT>
16bit NE2000 &amp; Compatible Network Cards also default to this IRQ.</DT>
</DIR>

<DT>
<B>IRQ 4</B></DT>

<DD>
Available. IRQ 4 usually services COM1/COM3, and provides the standard
serial mouse connection.</DD>

<DT>
<B>IRQ 5</B></DT>

<DD>
Available. This is the most common IRQ for a secondary printer port. This
is also the default IRQ for many sound cards, including the SoundBlaster
series. If a network card needs a low IRQ, 5 will usually do. A second
printer port can share this IRQ, since the printer only requests the port
when in use.</DD>

<DT>
<B>IRQ 6</B></DT>

<DD>
Floppy Drive controller. No user-definable options.</DD>

<DT>
<B>IRQ 7</B></DT>

<DD>
Primary parallel (printer) port. Some other Sound Card configurations will
also use this port, if the primary printer port is set to IRQ5.</DD>

<DT>
<B>IRQ 8</B></DT>

<DD>
Real Time Clock. No user-definable options.</DD>

<DT>
<B>IRQ 9</B></DT>

<DD>
Available. This IRQ overlaps to 2. IRQ 9 is a good IRQ to use for SCSI
host adapters, network cards, and sound cards that can't use IRQ5 for some
reason. SCSI cards should use IRQ 9 or 11. I have had no problems with
configuring 16bit Network Cards for IRQ5, 300h.</DD>

<DT>
<B>IRQ 10</B></DT>

<DD>
Available. This is a good IRQ for a network card, since most devices can't
use it. However, this is the most common IRQ used for Win95 when installing
your first Plug-n-Play device, especially P-n-P modems.</DD>

<DIR>
<DT>
There is also an instance where some Sound Cards (ESS, and other generics),
use what is called "Windows Sound System". They use IRQ10, with a 530h
or 550h address, while SoundBlaster emulation uses IRQ5 while in DOS.</DT>
</DIR>

<DT>
<B>IRQ 11</B></DT>

<DD>
Available. This IRQ is assinged by PCI motherboards for the FIRST slot,
which the Video Card is plaugged into. I have seen instances where a Network
Card, PCI SCSI CARD, and a Video Card were all using the same IRQ (Compaq
DeskPro6000). PCI URQ assignments are done through the system BIOS setup.</DD>

<DT>
<B>IRQ 12</B></DT>

<DD>
Available. This IRQ is primarily used for Imbedded PS/2 mouse ports, or
can be used by another device of you are using a Serial Mouse. If your
motherboard has in imbedded PS/2 mouse port, the availability of this device
can be disabled or enabled.</DD>

<DT>
<B>IRQ 13</B></DT>

<DD>
Math Coprocessor. No user-definable options, even if one does not exist
(386SX &amp; 486SX CPUs).</DD>

<DT>
<B>IRQ 14</B></DT>

<DD>
Hard disk controller (IDE). Each IDE channel requires its own IRQ. You
can control 2 IDE devices with 1 IRQ. This also has no user-definable options.</DD>

<DT>
<B>IRQ 15</B></DT>


<P>Secondary IDE channel. If you disable the secondary channel, this becomes
available. This is also done within the system BIOS for imbedded controllers.</DL>
<FONT SIZE=-1>The trick is to balance your IRQs so that the do not overlap.
Prioritize you devices by how picky they are. For instance, a COM port
will need to use IRQ 3 or 4 (see COM ports below). You can not put a modem
on IRQ 5, since it requires a COM port; just as your serial mouse does.
Devices that do not do well on high (above 7) IRQs, eg sound cards, should
be filled in next. The last things to worry about are devices that have
their own ROM to store IRQ and base IO addresses, like network and SCSI
cards. Network and SCSI cards will be able to use the high IRQs with no
problem. These defaults usually work fine:</FONT>
<PRE>
<B>Mouse&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; COM1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IRQ4

Modem/NIC&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; COM2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IRQ3

Sound Card&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no COM&nbsp; IRQ5

Printer&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no COM&nbsp; IRQ7

SCSI Card&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no COM&nbsp; IRQ09 (Third PCI Slot Assignment)

P-n-P Device&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?? COM&nbsp; IRQ10 (Second PCI Slot Assignment / P-n-P device - ISA Slot)

Video Card&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no COM&nbsp; IRQ11 (First PCI Slot Assignment)

PS/2 Bus Mouse&nbsp; no COM&nbsp; IRQ12

Secondary IDE&nbsp;&nbsp; no COM&nbsp; IRQ15 (Usually a CDROM)</B></PRE>
<FONT SIZE=-1>This is a very basic list, but it can be helpful. The number
of possibilities are countless, so you will need to piece your own puzzle
together. It is easier than you think after you try it.</FONT><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Also, on-board AGP video does not require an IRQ, so you
will have IRQ-10 available for devices.&nbsp; Some BIOSs also give you
an OPTION</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>to assign an IRQ to the VGA device.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1><B>The best advice I can give for avoiding conflicts is
to disable or remove that which are not going to use.</B> If you use an
internal modem, disable COM2 in your BIOS, or on your controller. If you
use a PS/2 mouse, use COM1 for a modem. If you do not use your 2nd IDE
channel, disable it. If you only use a printer on your parallel port, use
it in Standard mode, rather than Enhanced. Enhanced Mode will not let you
print any faster; it is for parallel devices (ZIP drives, CD-ROMs, LapLink)
that use a higher bandwidth for communications. If you are careful, you
should not need to disable unused ports, but it will give you more room
to maneuver.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>I have also seen COM1 assigned to IRQ10 when using a Plug-n-Play
modem, if COM1 is disabled in your BIOS.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>It is also not a good idea to place a CDROM on the same
port as your Primary (boot) hard drive. Hard drives run in true 32bit mode,
and placing a CDROM in the same cable will reduce the data transfer rate
of the CDROM. Placing the CDROM as the SECONDARY MASTER will maximize the
throughput of your CDROM drive. Even your Secondary hard disk will have
an almost 50% lower transfer rate than the primary.</FONT>

COM Port Settings</H2>
<FONT SIZE=-1>Here are the possible configurations for COM Ports:</FONT>
<PRE>
<B>COM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Interrupt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Address

---&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ---------&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -------

COM1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IRQ4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3f8h

COM2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IRQ3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2f8h

COM3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IRQ4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3e8h

COM4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IRQ3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3f8h</B></PRE>
<FONT SIZE=-1>Although there are 4 COM ports, there are only 2 IRQs for
them. In essence, you can have 4 serial devices attached, but use only
2 at a time. And since your mouse is usually in use, it is not a good idea
to use anything that shares an IRQ with the mouse. That only leaves us
with three simple configurations:</FONT>
<PRE>
<B>COM1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IRQ4

COM2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IRQ3

COM4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IRQ3</B></PRE>
<FONT SIZE=-1>If you need more devices, you can use a Bus Mouse to free
up COM1 / COM3, or buy a Multiport Board (known as a DigiBoard) which can
handle from 2 to 128 ports, on a different IRQ, and each port has it's
own 3-digit memory address. External Modems will work fine on any COM port,
including the DigiBoard ports.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>One good thing to remember is: EVEN com port numbers get
the ODD IRQ, and the ODD com ports get the EVEN IRQ.</FONT>

<H2>
Parallel Port Settings</H2>
<FONT SIZE=-1>Parallel port settings are similar to COM port settings.
A PC can use up to 3 parallel devices. Here are the default settings:</FONT>
<PRE>
<B>LPT Port&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IRQ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Address

--------&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ---&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -------

LPT1:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 278h

LPT2:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 378h

LPT3:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3bch</B></PRE>

<PRE><B></B></PRE>

<PRE><B><FONT FACE="Tahoma"><FONT SIZE=+1>Freeing up extra IQRs for PCI/ISA PnP devices:</FONT></FONT></B></PRE>

<PRE>With the USB port now avaialable, you can free up more IRQs for PCI/ISA use.</PRE>

<PRE><B>USB Mouse:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Frees IRQ-12 (Disable PS/2 Mouse Support In BIOS)
USB Keyboard:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Frees IRQ-1&nbsp; (Enable USB Keyboard Support In BIOS)
USB MODEMs:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Frees IRQ 3 and/or 4
USB Printer:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Frees IRQ 7 &amp; DMA Channel Associated with it</B>
</PRE>

<PRE>I have sucessfully placed a PCI SCSI adapter on IRQ-12 by using a USB Mouse.</PRE>

<PRE>IRQ needs will eventually be replaced with USB &amp; Fire-Wire devices.&nbsp; There will ne no
need to worry about free IRQs with the new devices.</PRE>

<PRE>Remember to make those FREED up IRQs available to PCI slot prioritys that are listed
in your BIOS setup.</PRE>

<PRE><B>PCI Slot 1 - IRQ12
PCI Slot 2 - IRQ11
PCI Slot 3 - IRQ10 or 9</B></PRE>

<PRE>You can then make IRQ1, 3, 4, 5, &amp; 7 available for ISA/PnP devices is using USB devices that
normally use those IRQs</PRE>
