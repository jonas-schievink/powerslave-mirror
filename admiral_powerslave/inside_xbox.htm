<font face="Arial, sans-serif">The first step to taking apart the Xbox
is flipping it over and peeling off the rubber feet to expose the
torque screw holes.&nbsp; Yes, nearly all of the screws used in the
Xbox are the dreaded torque screws, so you'll need an appropriate set
of drivers.&nbsp; The mounting holes are illustrated below.</font>
<p align="center"><img src="inside_xbox_files/ScrewHoles.jpg" border="0"
 height="390" width="520"></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">In addition to the mounting holes
under the rubber feet, Microsoft hid two other holes under tamper-proof
stickers as shown above.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">After extracting the torque screws,
flip over the console and carefully remove the top cover.&nbsp; The
insides of the Xbox are robustly shielded with sharp metal so it is
possible to cut yourself if you are not careful.</font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="inside_xbox_files/TopCover_Screws.jpg"
 border="0" height="408" width="469"></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">You can see the giant torque screws
immediately below the cover.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">We were simultaneously struck with
both how full the Xbox was and how much it looked like a PC.&nbsp; Here
is a picture of the Xbox with the top cover removed.</font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="inside_xbox_files/InsideXbox.jpg" border="0"
 height="427" width="533"></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">It is hard to see from this picture,
but both the hard drive and the 5X DVD-ROM drive share the same IDE
channel. </font></p>

<p><font color="#ffff00" face="Arial" size="5">The Drives</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">At first glance, the drives inside
the Xbox look like normal PC components but there are subtle
differences.&nbsp; The 5X DVD-ROM drive has a proprietary connector
that bundles power, and audio out into a single cable.</font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="inside_xbox_files/DVD_Connect.jpg"
 border="0" height="205" width="480"></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">From all appearances, the hard drive
is a standard Seagate model, but read on...</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p><font color="#ffff00" face="Arial" size="5">The Guts</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">After removing both drives along with
their rigid plastic mounting frames, we could see the motherboard and
power supply.&nbsp; In the photo below, the large passive heat sink
covers the Intel processor.&nbsp; The smaller heat sink and fan cool
the nVidia GPU.&nbsp; The IDE cable connecting the drives is attached
to the lone IDE connector.&nbsp; The motherboard itself is very small
-- about seven or eight inches square.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">The power supply does not have a
cover of its own so it is important to make sure the power cord is not
connected.</font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="inside_xbox_files/xboxguts.jpg" border="0"
 height="480" width="640"></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">We thought it was interesting that
the word "Microsoft" was silk-screened on the motherboard.</font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="inside_xbox_files/Microsoft.jpg" border="0"
 height="304" width="301"></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">What makes the Xbox special is the
nVidia chipset.</font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="inside_xbox_files/Chipset.jpg" border="0"
 height="450" width="443"></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">If you look closely in the photo
above, you can see the 800 MB/s HyperTransport traces connecting the
GPU (under the heat sink) and the MCP (the small chip in the lower left
bearing nVidia's logo).</font></p>

<font color="#ff0000" face="Arial, sans-serif">UPDAT</font><font
 face="Arial, sans-serif"><font color="#ff0000">E</font>:&nbsp; The
silkscreening on the memory was very light and difficult to read.&nbsp;
Although Micron had been publicly tapped as a source for Xbox memory,
we reexamined the chips in our Xbox carefully and the memory it
contained is actually from Samsung.&nbsp; The chips have the markings
"Samsung 136, K4D263238M-QC50"</font></div>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Looking at the 64 MB of Samsung DDR
SDRAM (composed of four chips -- two on each channel and two on each
side of the motherboard)</font></p>
<p><font color="#ffff00" face="Arial" size="5">The CPU</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">The large, passive CPU heat sink
ventilated directly by the system fan is easy to remove by flipping the
tension lever and stretching the base free from the mount.&nbsp; In the
picture below, you can see the CPU and GPU located very close together.</font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="inside_xbox_files/NB_CPU.jpg" border="0"
 height="328" width="502"></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">The CPU is simply a 733 MHz BGA
Mobile Celeron mounted directly to the motherboard.</font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="inside_xbox_files/CPU.jpg" border="0"
 height="268" width="302"></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Although the chip is outwardly a 0.18
micron Coppermine Mobile Celeron, it is unclear what FSB (Front-Side
Bus: the chip talks to the outside world through this) speed the chip
operates at.&nbsp; We had been told informally by Intel months ago that
the FSB speed would be 133 MHz -- which would make this chip a mutant
Celeron.&nbsp; Since 733 MHz&nbsp; a multiple of 133 MHz, the clock
speed suggests that the part might be running at 133 MHz (although 66
MHz is a possibility, we doubt that Microsoft would have accepted such
a severe and artificial limitation that would greatly undermine gaming
performance -- especially considering that the much more powerful AMD
Duron with a 200 MHz FSB was passed over at the last moment for this
chip).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">A very interesting CPU to consider
for game consoles is the soon-to-be-released
VIA C5X.&nbsp; Not only does this chip consume little power making
cooling solutions cheap and compact, but its two double-pumped SSE
units will likely make it a very strong gaming chip.&nbsp; The FPU has
also been completely redesigned greatly improving upon the C3's
decidedly weak floating point performance.</font></p>

<p><font color="#ffff00" face="Arial" size="5">Overclocking</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">There doesn't appear to be any way to
easily overclock the Xbox.&nbsp; It is determined to do so can find one
certain route by removing the clock crystal and supplying an external
clock signal.&nbsp; Be aware that every aspect of the machine will be
sped up as well, meaning that game play will also be faster -- perhaps
too fast if the adjustments are not made carefully.&nbsp; Also, since
the entire system would be overclocked, headroom is not likely to be
great.</font></p>
