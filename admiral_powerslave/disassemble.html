  <li>T10 (Inside The Xbox Screws) and T15 (Case Screws) Torx
screwdriver</li>
  <li>
    <div align="left">Flat head screwdriver (also known as a 'slot')</div>
  </li>
</ul>
<span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Disconnect all power and A/V
cords from your XBox and ensure that all devices including controllers,
compact discs and / or DVD&#8217;s are removed from the system.<br>
<br>
Turn your XBox upside down and remove all 4 screw caps (rubber
feet).&nbsp; Use your finger to press down on the tw0lables and run
across them till you find, and make a dimple to find the other two
screws.&nbsp; These caps and labels cover the XBox assembly screws.
(Tip: Pry the caps off gently using a small flat head screw
driver.)&nbsp;&nbsp; You can pry them off with your fingers too!!<br>
<br>
Remove the 6 screws using the T15 Torx driver.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can poke
a hole in the labels with the driver, and unscrew them, they will break
through the label, leaving it intact.&nbsp; Place the screws in a safe
spot.<br>
<br style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
After you have removed all 6 of the case screws, flip the XBox console
right side up and then carefully remove the cover.<br>
<br>
Remove the Power plug, and IDE (grey ribbon) cable from the XBox Hard
Drive and DVD Drive.&nbsp; Remove the white plug from the DVD drive,
the one with the yellow wires.&nbsp; Remove the HDD power cable from
the guides on the plastic tray.<br>
<br>
Use the T10 Torx driver to remove the 3 screws from the plastic trays
that hold the XBox DVD Drive and the Hard Drive. Removing these will
enable you to lift up both devices and expose the XBox motherboard; or,
you can lift the HDD out first, then the DVD drive.&nbsp; They
interlock, one on top of the other.<br>
<br>

Xbox:</span> Carefully remove the XBox Controller port daughter
board.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">For all other
XBox versions:</span> Remove the USB datacables from the motherboard.<br>
<br>
Using the T10 Torx driver remove the 11 screws. Once all 11 screws have
been removed carefully remove the XBox motherboard from the case.<br>
