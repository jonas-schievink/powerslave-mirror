<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span
 style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><big style="font-weight: bold;">Another
Method:</big><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">What you need:</span><br>
<br>
1) xboxhdm 1.9 (Found at xbins&#8217; in the directory: /XBOX/Operating
Systems/linux/distributions)<br>
2) Torx 10 And Torx 20 Screwdrivers - To Open XBOX<br>
3) A Spare/Blank PC Hardrive<br>
4) FTP Program (AceFTP, SmartFTP etc.)<br>
5) A blank CD-R/W and A CD Burner<br>
<br>
Steps:<br>
<br>
1. On your xbox's evox dashboard go to system utils and select backup.
While your waiting for that to finish, extract all files in xboxhdm 1.9
to your PC'S hard drive and open up the folder 'linux'. In that folder
is a folder called 'eeprom'. Once the backup is complete, on your PC
run the desired FTP program and access your xbox. Go to E:\
backup_linux\ and download a file called 'eeprom.bin' to the
xboxhdm\linux\eeprom folder of on your PC&#8217;s hard drive. Then go to the
root of your xbox and download the full folders of C:\ and E:\ to your
PC's hard drive to the xboxhdm\linux folder and overwrite the ones
already there.<br>
<br>
2. Now in the root of xboxhdm is a file named 'make-iso-win'. You must
run make-iso-win and wait for it to finish once it has finished. Now
burn the .iso which was created to a blank cd-r/w using nero or
alcohol, dvddecrypter etc. When burning is finished shutdown pc.<br>
<br>
3. Take out all other hard drives and put in the hard drive you wish to
make an xbox hard drive and set it to be the primary master. Boot up
your PC and as it is loading press whatever button to enter your BIOS
setup and set your PC to boot from CD. Now reset your PC and put the
cd-r/w with the .iso you created on it, in the cd/dvd drive. You should
be given a list of options.<br>
<br>
4. Choose Option 1 (by typing &#8216;1&#8217;) and press enter to boot VGA console
with xbox-drive utilities (default). Type &#8216;xboxhd&#8217; when it asks you for
a login. Another list of options will show up, choose option 1 again
(the one that says &#8216;Build a new Xbox HD from scratch&#8217;) and it will
begin to format and write the partition table etc. If you put your C:\
and E:\ onto the CD then when it asks you about them type yes and when
it asks you if you would like an F select yes, it is all pretty self
explanatory. Now quit and reboot your PC. If this worked you now have a
brand new nearly-usable xbox hard drive.<br>
<br>
5. Now for locking the hard drive. When it boot from the cd again, this
time type &#8216;3&#8217; and hit enter to boot linux with locking/unlocking
utilities. Next, type in &#8216;lockhd -a&#8217;. It will now search for the eeprom
on the CD and will automatically lock the hard drive. Now turn off the
PC and take out the hard drive when it has finished locking.<br>
<br>
Now put it back in your Xbox and load up and have fun!<br>

FOUND ON TWO DIFFERENT SITES<br>
<br>
It also said something about if you have a 137+Gb Hard Disk to use the
UnleashX Dashboard to do a format to get the extra space.&nbsp;&nbsp;
That tells me that if your bios doesn't have the LBA48 hack, you can
use it?&nbsp; I am looking into that.<br>
