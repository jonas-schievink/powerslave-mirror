</FONT><P>The AMD Athlon processor is available in speed grades of 650, 600, 550, and 500 MHz.</P>
<P>At 650MHz, the AMD Athlon is the world's fastest x86 processor.</P>

AMD's third-party infrastructure suppliers plan to deliver optimized chipsets, BIOS, and motherboard solutions that support the AMD Athlon processor. To enable the initial chipset solution for AMD Athlon processor-based systems, AMD has developed the AMD-750&trade; chipset, a complete system logic solution that features system and peripheral bus controllers designed to enhance performance for AMD Athlon processors. </P>

<FONT SIZE=2>The AMD Athlon processor is an x86-compatible, seventh-generation design featuring a superpipelined, nine-issue superscalar microarchitecture optimized for high clock frequency; the industry's first fully pipelined, superscalar floating point unit for x86 platforms; high-performance cache technology, including 128KB of on-chip level-one (L1) cache and a programmable, high-performance backside L2 cache interface; enhanced 3DNow!&trade; technology with 24 new instructions designed to improve integer math calculations, data movement for Internet streaming, and DSP communications; and the AMD Athlon system bus -- a 200MHz system interface based on the Alpha&trade; EV6 bus protocol with support for scalable multiprocessing. The initial versions of the AMD Athlon processor are manufactured on AMD's 0.25-micron process technology in Fab 25 in Austin, Texas. </P>

</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P>The AMD Athlon&trade; processor includes specific enhancements to the 3DNow!&trade; instruction set. The enhanced 3DNow! technology implemented in the AMD Athlon takes 3D multimedia performance to new heights and builds on the 21 instructions of AMD’s original 3DNow! technology—the first x86 instruction set to use superscalar SIMD floating-point techniques. Enhanced 3DNow! adds 24 new instructions—19 to improve MMX&trade; integer math calculations and enhance data movement for Internet streaming applications and 5 DSP extensions for soft modem, soft ADSL, Dolby Digital, and MP3 applications. This new DSP functionality of the AMD Athlon is not supported by the Pentium III.</P></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>The AMD Athlon&trade; processor's on-chip L1 cache is 128KB - four times the size of the Pentium&reg; III processor's L1 cache. The AMD Athlon processor's advanced L2 cache design is scalable in size and speed. The initial version of the AMD Athlon processor has a 512KB L2 cache, and future versions are planned to offer L2 cache sizes scaling to 8MB, enabling a total system cache larger than any x86 processor solution currently available.</FONT></TD>
