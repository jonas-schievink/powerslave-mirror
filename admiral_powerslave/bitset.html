<br style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
</font><span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">For a DVD player or
drive to identify what kind of disc is loaded, it
queries the so called "Book Type Field" found in the lead-in section of
each DVD disc. These few bits, commonly referred to as "compatibility
bitsettings" tell the drive which low-level format specification does
the media conform to, such as DVD-ROM, DVD-R, DVD-RW, DVD+R or DVD+RW.</span><br
 style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
<br style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
<span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Most DVD players will read a
DVD+RW or DVD+R disc without any problems,
however a small minority of them report a disc error when a disc is
loaded that is not marked as a "DVD-ROM" disc in the compatibility
bits. Ususally, these players are physically able to read the disc
(since DVD+RW reflectivity is identical to that of a dual layered
DVD-Video disc, which all players must be capable of reading), but
their compatibility problems are due to different interpretations of
these bits in the various firmware versions. In most cases, the problem
can be solved by updating the drives firmware, but with Xbox, you can't.</span><br

<br style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
<span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">When a firmware fix is
unavailable, or when you want to increase
changes of playability when you give the disc to others with an unknown
player, you could solve the issue by marking the DVD+R or DVD+RW disc
as a DVD-ROM disc. This is what's called "changing the compatibility
bitsettings". To instruct your DVD recorder to mark your DVD+R or
DVD+RW discs as DVD-ROM, a special procedure must be followed. On a
DVD+RW video recorder, you need to press a number of keys on the remote
control. With a DVD+RW PC drive, you'll need a special utility program
to accomplish this.</span><br style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">

<span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> You only need to apply this
special compatibility setting to a
disc if you encounter reading problems with your DVD equipment. Players
and drives that need the DVD-ROM setting for DVD+RW discs are marked
with (cs) in the compatibility list. DVD+RW drive vendors advice you
not to apply these setting unless you specifically need so in your
situation, however we think that no DVD Drive<span class="kLink1"

USING BITSETTING</big><br style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
<span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"> Use the bitsetting (Set
Booktype) feature in your bitsetting software to set your
DVD+R/DVD+RW/DVD+R DL Media (Only DVD+R/+RW Media) backup to DVD-ROM
for much higher compatibility with older DVD players and Game Consoles
such as XBOX and PS2. Bitsetting is done during the burning process
when bitsetting DVD+R Media. You can also set/change your DVD+RW
Media's bitsetting/booktype, but the difference is that you can bitset
DVD+RW Media even AFTER you have burned it.</span><br

Bitsetting unfortunately has its restrictions when it comes to which
burner can bitset. Burners that cannot be bitset are burners which are
not Ricoh engine based, which bitsetting has based its technology
around. For other burners that are not Ricoh Burners you can try the
following bitsetting utilities found in the article/links below:<br>
<br>
1. A very nice Bitsetting article titled: Apply Compatibility
Bitsettings using a DVD+R/+RW PC Drive by DVDplusRW.org. You can also
download the software DVD BitSetter.<br>
<br>
2. Or DVDInfoPro - Bitsetting capable for LG, BENQ, NU, NEC, BTC,
Liteon, Micro Advantage<br>
<br>
3. Or DVD Decrypter - Bitsetting capable for Plextor, NEC, BenQ, LG,
LITE-ON, Nu Tech/QSI and Ricoh Burners<br>
<br>
4. For NEC Burners (excluding ND-2500A) you can use a programs called:
WinBtype or DVD Bitsetter. If you have an ND-2500A, you can use patched
firmwares to enable its bitsetting, which can be found on the inernet:
ND-2500A Bitsetting Firmware. <br>

When I burn a DVD+R with Nero 6 it automatically sets the book-type to
DVD-ROM.<br>

I have a ND-2150 NEC DVD DL +/-R RW Drivem and the Equivelent
CyberDrive DX16DL<br>
