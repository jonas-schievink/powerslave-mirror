</span></big></big>Soldering is a skill that is handy to know for many
types of construction and repair. For modern small appliances, it is
less important than it once was as solderless connectors have virtually
replaced solder for internal wiring.<br>
<br>
However, there are times where soldering is more convenient. Use of the
proper technique is critical to reliability and safety. A good solder
connection is not just a bunch of wires and terminals with solder
dribbled over them. When done correctly, the solder actually bonds to
the surface of the metal (usually copper) parts.<br>
<br>
Effective soldering is by no means difficult but some practice may be
needed to perfect your technique.<br>
<br>
The following guidelines will assure reliable solder joints:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Only use rosin core solder (e.g., 60/40 tin/lead)
for electronics work. A 1 pound spool will last a long time and costs
about $10. Suggested diameter is .030 to .060 inches for appliances.
The smaller size is preferred as it will be useful for other types of
precision electronics repairs or construction as well. The rosin is
used as a flux to clean the metal surface to assure a secure bond.
NEVER use acid core solder or the stuff used to sweat copper pipes! The
flux is corrosive and it is not possible to adequately clean up the
connections afterward to remove all residue.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Keep the tip of the soldering iron or gun clean
and tinned. Buy tips that are permanently tinned - they are coated and
will outlast countless normal copper tips. A quick wipe on a wet sponge
when hot and a bit of solder and they will be as good as new for a long
time. (These should never be filed or sanded).<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Make sure every part to be soldered - terminal,
wire, component leads - is free of any surface film, insulation, or
oxidation. Fine sandpaper or an Xacto knife may be used, for example,
to clean the surfaces. The secret to a good solder joint is to make
sure everything is perfectly clean and shiny and not depend on the flux
alone to accomplish this. Just make sure the scrapings are cleared away
so they don't cause short circuits.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Start with a strong mechanical joint. Don't depend
on the solder to hold the connection together. If possible, loop each
wire or component lead through the hole in the terminal. If there is no
hole, wrap them once around the terminal. Gently anchor them with a
pair of needlenose pliers.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Use a properly sized soldering iron or gun: 20-25
W iron for fine circuit board work; 25-50 W iron for general soldering
of terminals and wires and power circuit boards; 100-200 W soldering
gun for chassis and large area circuit planes. With a properly sized
iron or gun, the task will be fast - 1 to 2 seconds for a typical
connection - and will result in little or no damage to the circuit
board, plastic switch housings, insulation, etc. Large soldering jobs
will take longer but no more than 5 to 10 seconds for a large expanse
of copper. If it is taking too long, your iron is undersized for the
task, is dirty, or has not reached operating temperature. For appliance
work there is no need for a fancy soldering station - a less than $10
soldering iron or $25 soldering gun as appropriate will be all that is
required.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Heat the parts to be soldered, not the solder.
Touch the end of the solder to the parts, not the soldering iron or
gun. Once the terminal, wires, or component leads are hot, the solder
will flow via capillary action, fill all voids, and make a secure
mechanical and electrical bond. Sometimes, applying a little from each
side will more effectively reach all nooks and crannies.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Don't overdo it. Only enough solder is needed to
fill all voids. The resulting surface should be concave between the
wires and terminal, not bulging with excess solder.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Keep everything absolutely still for the few
seconds it takes the solder to solidify. Otherwise, you will end up
with a bad connection - what is called a 'cold solder joint'.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * A good solder connection will be quite shiny - not
dull gray or granular. If your result is less than perfect reheat it
and add a bit of new solder with flux to help it reflow. <br>
<br>
Practice on some scrap wire and electronic parts. It should take you
about 3 minutes to master the technique!<br>
