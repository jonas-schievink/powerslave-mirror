 name="old"></a>Much of
the hacking is going to stem from the discovery of an all-media
bootable kiosk demo disk.
Many hackers will instantly recognize the value of this, but it&#8217;s still
interesting to reflect on the significance of this find. Like the
original Xbox, the Xbox360 uses a media flag on its executables. The
media flag tells the OS what type of media it should be on; typically,
games are released with the flag set to Microsoft&#8217;s proprietary secure
Xbox DVD format (which is in itself not that secure&#8230;). Significantly,
only the executable is signed for a game; the data sections typically
are not signed (presumably for performance reasons). Thus, one has the
ability to fuzz the executable by corrupting the data sections,
potentially invoking a buffer overrun or some other unintentional
behavior&#8211;if one could effectively modify the data sections. Remember
that this is normally not possible, since modifying the data segment
requires making a copy to a writeable media, and this contradicts the
signed media flag.<br>
<br>
Microsoft was in such a hurry to get the demo nachines out that they
forgot to set the media protection on the kiosk demo discs. This leaves
hackers with the posibility to hack around with this disc,
and it will load from a normal DVD backup! Team Pi also noted that the
all datafiles on this disc are not signed in any way, and will allow
for extensive modification for producing exploits to further their
efforts to hack the 360.&nbsp; Playable (hackable) games on the Kiosk
Demo disc: Call of Duty 2, Hexic, Kameo, King Kong. It also includes
lots of game and accessory demos in video format. Nothing ripped, just
foreign videos were downsampled to fit onto a single layer
DVD.&nbsp;&nbsp; All you have to do is find, and burn the ISO to a
DVD-R and it will play in the 360 without any modifications.<br>
<br>
THIS was fixed with the first or second update through Microsoft.&nbsp;
Kisok discs will not work in any xbox that took the update, or ant
newly MFGed Xbox's.&nbsp; If you have an Xbox that was made before Marh
06, and have never been on live, EVER, then the Kiosk disc will
probablt work.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
If you manually downloaded and made the disc for Backward Compatibility
issues, they may have slid the update in there as well.&nbsp; You need
a VIRGIN xbox, made before March of 2006.<br>

<big style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="flash"></a>Flashing your drive</big><br>
---------------------------<br>
You must obtain the propery items, of course.<br>
<br>
For ms28 firmware versions of drive you will need to use the Vcc method
or the VIA SATA 10 sec method to read/write flash. Refer to <a

<br>
Advisable to make a backup of your dvd drive firmware first.("mtkflash
r /m orig.bin")<br>
<br>
In Windows, copy orig.bin to same directory as this release (same
directory as xtrem42a.bin/Xtreme42b.bin and X360SAM.exe)<br>
<br>
Double click "Make X42a.bin" or "Make X42b.bin" to create x42a.bin
(Xtreme4.2A firmware with your key from orig.bin) or x42b.bin
(Xtreme4.2B firmware with your key from orig.bin). Thanks to eXOBeX for
X360SAM.EXE<br>
<br>
Copy x42a.bin or x42b.bin to boot disk<br>
<br>
Power off PC<br>
<br>
Plug SATA cable from DVD drive to PC. Power cable drive still connected
to Xbox 360<br>
Power on Xbox 360<br>
Power on PC<br>
Boot with standard dos boot disk with included mtkflash utility<br>
<br>
Run "mtkflash w /m x42a.bin" or "mtkflash w /m x42b.bin" <br>
<br>
<br>
<big style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="ss"></a>Extracting Security
Sector</big><br>
---------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Ensure SATA cable is plugged from drive to PC.<br>
(This is very important as may be possible in future for console to
detect modified firmware due to Inquiry routine enabled for Windows)<br>
<br>
Power on Xbox 360.<br>
Insert Enable0800 DVD into drive. Wait 5 or so seconds then remove the
Enable0800 DVD. Drive now in 0800 mode.<br>
Turn on PC and wait for Windows to boot<br>
Insert original game disk into drive and wait for windows to detect
disk change<br>
Run DVDinfoPro<br>
Enter the following four custom cdb commands:<br>
<br>
AD 00 FF 02 FD FF FE 00 08 00 01 C0<br>
AD 00 FF 02 FD FF FE 00 08 00 03 C0<br>
AD 00 FF 02 FD FF FE 00 08 00 05 C0<br>
AD 00 FF 02 FD FF FE 00 08 00 07 C0<br>
<br>
Then save hexadecimal display as bin file as SS.bin, the average being
about 2048 bytes in length, some may vary.<br>
<br>
Here is something you need to know about the SS, and that is each game
has a different one.&nbsp; What is also good to know, is that every
game of that title will have the same SS for that Region.&nbsp; What
that means is, every Oblivion in Region 1 has the same Security
Sector.&nbsp; So, someone who already has done a backup of Oblivion,
could give you the SS.BIN file from their Oblivion, and it will work
for your backup of Oblivion.&nbsp; <br>

Select User Data (2048 bytes/block)<br>
Click Start Extraction<br>
Enter filename as game.iso and click Save<br>
