Qwix:</span></big></big></big></big></big>
      <p style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">What is Qwix and what can
it do?<br>
The following is taken right from the Qwix website<br>
      </p>
      <p style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Qwix
is a very simple to use XBOX Remote File Management and ISO Creation
Tool. That's a pretty complicated description, so let me try again.
Qwix lets you do a variety of tasks VERY easily, and right from your
PC. Have a bunch of ISO's sitting on your PC that you need to load onto
your XBOX? Open up Qwix and use the ISO batch upload tool. Just tell it
where your ISOs are, and where you want them to be on the XBOX, and
then let it fire. It will automatically extract the ISO's out into
properly named folders in your games directory. It pulls the game name
from the ISO, and even let's you change it if that isn't what you want
it to be called in the games menu.</p>
      <p style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Ok, that's fine and
all, but what else can it do? Well, along that same path, it also
creates ISOs for you. You select a game from your XBOX that you want to
create an ISO from, and tell it where to save on your PC. You can even
choose to crosslink files, which means that it will take common areas
of the game and "cross" them so that they don't have to appear multiple
times. That saves valuable diskspace, and can change a DVDR game into a
CDR game!</p>
      <p style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Beyond that? Well, if you
are also using
Avalaunch, then you need to go into your avalaunch.xml and make sure
that BOOST mode is enabled, because you are gonna love that. When
combined with Avalaunch, Qwix has the ability to upload ISO's to your
xbox at speeds much faster than you could achieve with a normal FTP
client. Give it a try, compare it, and watch Qwix get the files there 3
times faster!<br>
      <br>
      <br>

 class="style45">Configure Qwix:</span></big></big><br>
You keep talking about Avalaunch how can I upgrade my dashboard? Click <a
 href="http://biline.ca/xbox-hd.htm" target="_parent">Here</a> to find
out. <br>
Now that we know what it does lets start by showing you how to
configure Qwix so you can transfer files to your Xbox. If you just
downloaded Qwix it's compressed using the '.rar' format you'll need <a
 href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm" target="_blank">Winrar</a>
to extract the file, uncompress the file into a folder of your choice.
No install is required simply double-click the file called Qwix.exe,
when launched for the first time a window opens, it will warn you that
a connection must be created before you can use Qwix click 'Ok' to
continue you will see the main menu</p>
      <p style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><img

      <span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">&lt;&gt;From
the main screen where it says 'Active Connection' click the 'Add'
button to bring up the Connections sub-menu, here you need to fill out
the fields with your Xbox 'IP' address (most dashboards have a way to
view this under the settings/network menu) for 'Description' enter
whatever you want, leave the Port at 21 setting alone, check off the
box that says 'Use passive FTP' now press the 'Test Connection' button
at the bottom if everything is ok you will see the 'Connection
successful' message. If you don't get this message double-check all
your settings and network cables etc.. also at this point if the </span><em

      <span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Select the Joystick Icon
from the left side of the screen and click the
'Scan Titles' button to populate the screen with all the Titles
currently installed on your Xbox (check off the 'Download Icons' box)
you will see the Icon associated with the game. to manage titles simply
right-click on any title to open the sub-menu (which is shown in the
photo below) from here you can Rename, Launch or Delete the game along
with any save-games associated with that game (don't worry you have the
option to keep the saves) Qwix also tells you the size of the game and
number of files and folders installed and if the region is NTSC/PAL or
both. </span>

 class="style45">Creating an '.iso' image
with Qwix:</span></big></big><br style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
      <span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">The '.iso' making
process has really improved!&nbsp; You used to have to
download an illegal file called 'gdfimage' (illegal because it was
created by Microsoft) it was dos based and had no progress bar then a
few other programs came along but sometimes the '.iso' created was not
useable (this was due to the authors trying to develop a "gdfimage"
program without using any of Microsoft's code) well Qwix makes 100%
compatible .iso's and has a wonderfully simple way to do this! <br>
      <br>
Click
the image with 'Create ISO' under it from the left-side of the screen,
now pick your source it can be a folder that is on your Xbox (using the
FTP Folder) or from
your local PC for the example below we'll create one from a local
folder on drive G:\CS-V8S2, you do this by selecting the 'Local Folder'
button, then click the 3 dots (...) that are right across this opens a
window where you can browse to the folder you will use.<br>
      <br>
If you are going to use ()FTP Folder and want to build an ISO directly
from the DVD drive if Xbox, just type "D:\" and go!<br>
      <br>
Or pick a HDD&nbsp; Loaded game folder like
"F:\GAMES\Defender".&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      </span>
      <p><img src="xbox-qwix_files/qwix_6.jpg" height="494" width="600">
      </p>
      <p style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Now
press the 'Create ISO' button another window opens, here select the
folder you wish to put the .iso and give it a unique name so that
you'll know what the heck the '.iso' is later.</p>
      <p><img src="xbox-qwix_files/qwix_7.jpg" height="356" width="476"></p>
      <p><span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Hit the save button
and Qwix will display a progress box that
pretty
well describes the whole process while its running once complete you'll
see the ISO file created box click 'OK' congratulations you have your
first '.iso'</span> </p>

      <p><span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Now
if you had chosen the 'FTP Folder' option instead of 'Local Folder' you
would of course been choosing a folder from your Xbox and creating the
.iso on your PC this is an ideal way to back-up any games and of course
you're creating the .iso image at the same time! If you want to
transfer the game back for some reason you can , if you want to burn
the .iso image you can, use any DVD-writing program that supports
burning from .iso's and you will have a playable back-up (of course
only works on modded Xbox) Nero Burning Rom is my favorite Application
for this type of work.</span><a style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"

Click the image with 'Load ISO' under it from the left-side of the

select one called CS-V8S2.iso, once selected click the 'Open' button.</p>

            <p class="style2">Another
window will open that basically wants to know where the extracted files

drive <em>'G:\'</em>, you can select any folder that resides on the
drive if you want to. you will see the Extraction progress bar with the
completed message once the selected .iso has been successfully
extracted. The main purpose for extracting an .iso is so that you can
see the files that are contained in the game, the reason for doing this
is twofold you need the game to be extracted is for reason it requires
a patch but usually it's so that larger games (over 4.3 gig) can be
checked for unwanted language files that can be discarded to save room.
The Xbox often uses bink or smacker video files which can be recoded to
save space, (I'll talk about this later and explain where to get the
tools and how to use them to accomplish the recoding).<a name="load"></a></p>

      <span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Now this is one of the
best reasons to use Qwix (especially with
Avalaunch dashboard installed as it will be over 3x faster) lets say
you toasted you hard-drive and want to re-install all of your favorite
games to it. since you created back-up .iso's of all your games this
will be a snap what you do is open Qwix and select the icon from the
left-side of the screen with 'Load ISO' under it, now click the 'Load
ISO' button when the new window opens browse to where your back-up
.iso's are and select all of them at once by clicking the first file
and hold the 'Shift' key while selecting the last file, all of the,
iso's in that directory will be automatically queued, if you wish to
select only a few .iso's click each one while holding down the 'Ctrl'
key instead. click the 'Open' button when done to complete the queuing
process.</span> </p>

      <p style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Now
in the example below I've only loaded one file but if multiple files
were selected each one would show up in this screen, whats important to
note is that the bottom of the screen tells you the total space
required to load all of the .iso's you selected. This really helps when
you space is tight and you want to ensure everything will fit!</p>
      <p><img src="xbox-qwix_files/qwix_15.jpg" height="381" width="600"></p>
      <p><span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">When
you're ready simply click the 'FTP Upload All' button and sit back as
Qwix loads all of your files, of course a progress box is displayed so
you know how long this will take. I have transferred over 40 gigs of
files in less than an hour, at an average of 9 megs per second if
you're transfer appears to be very slow quit the process and reboot
you're PC I've noticed that after using some file-sharing software that
my speed was greatly reduced.</span> </p>

      <span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">After
the upload process is complete you'll see a window with some statistics
about the transfer in the example above I moved 2.5 gigs to the Xbox in
less than 2 minutes at an average transfer rate of 22,510 KB/s!</span><br
