The harddisk is not locked in any way. A completely zero drive will
only be read by the Xbox 360 if the relevent headers are in place on
the disk.<br>
<br>
A FATX partition exists on the drive.<br>
<br>
For a drive to be considered valid it must have the 'Plain text hard
disk info' and MS logo PNG. If these elements do not exist then no HDD
is detected. So there is no way for third parties to manufacture hard
disks without a license or without infringing Microsoft's copyright.<br>
<br>
Your XB360 serial number is required when formatting a HDD.<br>
<br>
The drive's capacity is reported as 13GB by the 360 immediately after
formatting.<br>
<br>

<br>
There are two different rom versions 0046DH (Core) 0047DJ
(Premium).&nbsp; When they are swapped between each XB360 they will not
boot game discs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They may be marrying DVD drives to
the Xbox as well.<br>
<br>
The DVD drive uses the standard 7-pin Serial ATA connectors with a
custom power connector.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
The 360 has a standard dual layer SATA DVD-ROM drive manufactured by
Hitachi-LG - GDR-3120L.<br>
<br>
The 360 does DVD not use the ISO9660 or UDF filesystem for the content
on
game DVDs.&nbsp; It is supposed to be the standard xboxdvdfs, however
the offset and layer breakpoint are different.<br>
<br>
XB360 calls it \Device\CdRom0\ (found in default.xex)<br>
<br>
Philips XBOX1 drive firmware, different dumps of the VAD6011 firmware
are all identical. This means, no key or serial is present in the
firmware.&nbsp; However, dumps of a Toshiba/Samsung TS-H943 DVD-ROM
drive. are 16 bytes are different. The difference is at offset 0x401A -
0x4029.&nbsp; A 16 byte difference was also the case with the GDR-3120
dumps.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
All clues indicate that each x360 dvd-rom firmware contains an unique
key.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
There doesn't appear to be a match of the key to a console id, serial,
or drive serial. It's probably a unique key used in the AES routine to
encrypt/decrypt communications between console and drive. Something
which is new for the x360.</span><span class="font"></span><br>

The system boots with the SATA HDD removed, DUH.&nbsp; The system boots
with the SATA DVD drive dissconected.&nbsp; The system boots with a
SATA HDD placed on the DVD side, and boots with no SATA devices
connected.&nbsp; Conencting a normal store bought SATA drive, system
boots, but the drive goes undetected.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
System boots without the
fans connected, why?&nbsp; <br>
<br>
The 360 is capable of delivering graphics at least as impressive as a
far more expensive gaming PC.&nbsp; YOu can upgrade a PC though, not
the XB360 so game makers have to "optimize" instead.<br>

The XB360 Memory unit looks like it can be upgraded to 128Mb - there is
a spot to place another memory chip.&nbsp; It would be the same
tecnique as upgrading the memory on Xbox - the spaces are there, the
chips are not.<br>
