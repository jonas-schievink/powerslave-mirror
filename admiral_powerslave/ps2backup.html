<br>
I am not going into DETAL, nor is this MY method, I do not have a
modded PS2.&nbsp; I found these instructions on the Internet, so you
can search yourself and look.<br>
<br>
Ritek Disc for PS2 games, Ritek are very dark purple, and this is
better for coping PS2 games. <br>
Princo Discs are a light purple will work but better of with the Ritek
Discs.<br>
<br>
Any PS2 from version 4 onwards should play the +R discs, however,
compatiblity is assured with DVD-R.<br>
<br>
You should burn at 1 or 2x, as with Xbox.<br>
